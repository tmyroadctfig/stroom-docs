published HTML version of these documents are available to view at here. You can also download a PDF version or a zip file of all the HTML documentation from here.\n\nIf you'd like to jump straight in then see the Quick Start Guide. \nAlternatively, if you'd just like to see Stroom running then follow the very simple steps here.\nA series of HOWTO Recipes for various elements of Stroom can be found here\nStroom\nStroom is a data processing, storage and analysis platform. It is scalable - just add more CPUs / servers for greater throughput. It is suitable for processing high volume data such as system logs, to provide valuable insights into IT performance and usage.\nStroom provides a number of powerful capabilities:\n\nData ingest. Receive and store large volumes of data such as native format logs. Ingested data is always available in its raw form.\nData transformation pipelines. Create sequences of XSL and text operations, in order to normalise or export data in any format. It is possible to enrich data using lookups and reference data.\nIntegrated transformation development. Easily add new data formats and debug the transformations if they don't work as expected.\nScalable Search. Create multiple indexes with different retention periods. These can be sharded across your cluster.\nStatistics. Record counts or values of items over time, providing answers to questions such as \"how many times has a specific machine provided data in the last hour/day/month?\"\nDashboards. Run queries against your indexes or statistics and view the results within custom visualisations.\n\nBenefits\nSystem event data can come from many kinds of technology, this makes it highly heterogeneous with many different formats in use. As technologies are invented, new event types and log formats must be understood and processed correctly. Technology changes so rapidly that the auditing team risks being left behind.\nStroom is designed to offer a way to mitigate this risk, and has matured into an application that scales well to billions of events a day - sufficient to ingest and process the system events generated by the IT of a large organisation.\nThe person who introduces a new log format is probably best placed to describe it. Stroom provides these experts with tools that make it easy to normalise data, essentially crowdsourcing the problem. An organisation can ask their employees to configure Stroom whenever they introduce a new technology, and have confidence that it will be able to be properly audited.\nArchitecture\nStroom 5.x is a Java web application that runs on Apache Tomcat, with Apache Lucene indexes over a compressed data store. It uses two MySQL RDBMSs to persist application configuration and metadata. \nStroom v6.x uses a more service oriented architecture with a number of additional peripheral services such as stroom-auth, stroom-stats, stroom-query-elastic, stroom-annotations, etc. The core Stroom application and the majority of the services all run on DropWizard using embedded Jetty.\nCurrently Stroom has only been tested with Google Chrome. For this reason some functionality may not work correctly in other browsers. Now that Stroom is an open source project, support for other browsers will be improved.\nThere are several optional components for different use cases:\n\nStroom Proxy - An application that receives and forwards data to Stroom.\nStroom Stats - An HBase based service for storing and querying aggregates of event data.\nStroom Stats - An HBase based service for storing and querying aggregates of event data (still in development).\nStroom Annotations - A service for recording data relating to events or records in Stroom (still in development).\nStroom Query Elastic - A service to allow Stroom dashboards to query Elastic Search indexes.\nStroom Agent - An application that extracts data from sources. \nEvent Logging XML Schema - A common language for describing audit events.\nEvent Logging JAXB Library - A Java library to help client systems send events to Stroom.\nContent Packs - Transformation packages for standard log formats (e.g. Windows, Linux) into Logging Events XML.\n\nScreenshots\nSome screenshots of the application can be seen here.\nState of the Project\nStroom v5.0 and v5.1 represent the first open source releases of Stroom and are suitable for use in a production environment. Stroom v6.x is currently in development with alpha and beta releases available for testing.\nFuture\nAlthough Stroom is a mature product it is receiving more active development effort than ever. Work is underway to evolve the existing architecture and add new features:\n\nA rule engine for notifying analysts about particular event scenarios\nScalable temporal state storage that could be used by rules or dashboards\nNew visualisations to improve analysis\nA modularised, micro-service-based architecture\nFurther integration with the Hadoop ecosystem\n\nDevelopers and Contributors\nIf you want to contribute to the development of Stroom or its related repositories please see here.\nFor details of how get started setting up a Stroom development environment see here.\nStroom Content\nA lot of the power of Stroom comes from the content that is developed within it. The content includes XSLT transformations, data-splitter definitions, dashboards, visualisations, processing pipeline definitions, etc. The content developed within Stroom can be exported and shared between other Stroom installations. The content can be packaged into convenient content pack zip files.\nGeneric Stroom content is available here\nStroom visualisations (for use in dashboards) are available here\n"},"release-notes.html":{"url":"release-notes.html","title":"Release Notes","keywords":"","body":"v6.0\nOAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect authentication\nAuthentication for Stroom provided by an external service rather than a service internal to Stroom. This change allows support for broader corporate authentication schemes and is a key requirement for enabling the future microservice architecture for Stroom.\nAPI keys for third party clients\nAnyone wishing to make use of the data exposed by Stroom's services can request an API key. This key acts as a password for their own applications. It allows administrators to secure and manage access to Stroom's data.\nHBase backed statistics store\nThis new implementation of statistics (Stroom-Stats) provides a vastly more scalable time series DB for large scale collection of Stroom's data aggregated to various time buckets. Stroom-Stats uses Kafka for ingesting the source data.\nData receipt filtering\nData arriving in Stroom has meta data that can be matched against a policy so that certain actions can be taken. This could be to receive, drop or reject the data.\nFiltering of data also applies to Stroom proxy where each proxy can get a filtering policy from an upstream proxy or a Stroom instance.\nData retention policies\nThe length of time that data will be retained in Strooms stream store can be defined by creating data retention rules. These rules match streams based on their meta data and will automatically delete data once the retention period associated with the rule is exceeded.\nDashboard linking\nLinks can be created in dashboards to jump to other dashboards or other external sites that provide additional contextual information.\nSearch API\nThe search system used by Dashboards can be used via a restful API. This provides access to data stored in search indices (including the ability to extract data) and statistics stores. The data fetched via the search API can be received and processed via an external system.\nKafka appender and filter\nNew pipeline elements for writing XML or text data to a Kafka topic. This provides more options for using Stroom's data in other systems.\nv5.0\nInitial open source release\nFine grained permissions for explorer items\nUsers can be added to user groups and individual users and groups can have various permissions (e.g. Use, Read, Update, Delete) on individual items available in the explorer tree.\nRaw streaming\nData can be streamed in it's raw form from the stream store to multiple destinations without any transformation taking place.\nHDFS appender\nPipeline XML/text data can be writen out to a HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) cluster. This increases the options for using Stroom's data for other purposes.\nDashboard enhancements\nDate and time operators can be used to specify times in search expressions. These include constants such as now(), second(), minute(), hour(), day(), week(), month() and year(). You can also perform simple date time artithmetic in expressions such as day() - 2d or hour() - 30m.\nDashboards can be configured to automatically run/query when they are opened and can also refresh on a configurable time interval.\nDashboards can use replacement variables in query expressions. The value to use for any variable can be set for the whole dashboard in a text area at the top of the dashboard.\n"},"screenshots.html":{"url":"screenshots.html","title":"Screenshots","keywords":"","body":"Screenshots\nBrowse stored data\n\nCreate pipelines to transform data\n\nBrowse XML schemas used to validate data\n\nCreate custom indexes to search the data\n\nCreate custom visualisations for your data by directly editing script\n\nCreate dashboards that incorporate tables and other visualisations for your data\n\n"},"quick-start-guide/quick-start.html":{"url":"quick-start-guide/quick-start.html","title":"Quick-start guide","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Quick-Start Tutorial\nIn this quick-start guide you will learn how to use Stroom to get from this CSV, which looks like this:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application\n1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap\n2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex\n...\nTo this XML:\n\n\n   \n      1\n      10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06\n      159.161.108.105\n      217.151.32.69\n      Tres-Zap\n   \n   \n      2\n      633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a\n      210.14.34.58\n      133.136.48.23\n      Sub-Ex\n   \n  ...\n\nYou will go from a clean vanilla Stroom to having a simple pipeline that takes in CSV data and outputs that data transformed into XML.

In this tutorial we'll be uploading data but the result will be the same: raw event data sitting on a feed.\nA lot of Stroom's functionality is available through right-click context menus. If you right-click  System in the tree you can create new things. Create a new folder and call it something like Stroom 101:\n\nRight-click again and create a feed. The name needs to be capitalised, e.g. CSV_IN.\n\n\nThis will open a new tab for the feed. We want to add some data to the feed so click on Data at the top of the tab. \n\n\nThen click the green up arrow () to get the file upload dialog.\n\nWe're going to be putting in unprocessed events, known in Stroom as raw events. That's the type of stream this feed will contain, so that's the Stream Type you need to select. \n\n\n\n\nDownload this file, then click choose file from the dialog, select the file, and then ok everything until you're back at the feed.\n\nThat's it, there's now data in Stroom. You should be able to see it in the data table (you might need to click the refresh () button:\n\nNow you can do all sorts of things with the data: transform it, visualise it, index it. It's Pipelines that allow all these things to happen.\n"},"quick-start-guide/process/process.html":{"url":"quick-start-guide/process/process.html","title":"Processing the data","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Quick-Start Guide - Processing\nCreate a pipeline\nPipelines control how data is processed in Stroom. Typically you're going to want to do a lot of the same stuff for every pipeline, i.e. similar transformations, indexing, writing out data. You can actually create a template pipeline and inherit from it, tweaking what you need to for this or that feed. We're not doing that now because we want to show how to create one from scratch.\n\n\nCreate a pipeline by right-clicking our Stroom 101 folder. Call it something like CSV to XML pipeline.\nSelect Structure from the top of the new tab. This is the most important view for the pipeline because it shows what will actually happen on the pipeline.\nCheck Advanced Mode so that we can actually edit things.\n\n\nWe already have a Source element. Unlike most other pipeline elements this isn't something we need to configure. It's just there to show the starting point. Data gets into the pipeline via other means - we'll describe this in detail later.\nAdd a data splitter\nData splitters are powerful, and a lot we can say about them. Here we're just going to make a basic one.\nCreate a CSV splitter\nWe have CSV in the following form:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application\n1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap\n2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex\nTo process this we need to know if there's a header row, and what the delimiters are. This is a job for a Data Splitter. \nThe splitter is actually a type of Text Converter, so lets create one of those:\n\nCall it something like CSV splitter. In the new tab you need to tell the Text Converter that it'll be a Data Splitter:\n\nNow go to the Conversion tab. What you need to put in here is specific to the built-in Data Splitter functionality, so I'm just going to tell you what you're going to need:\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see that it uses the data-splitter-v3.0.1.xsd that we imported earlier. Save it by clicking the save icon ().\nSo we now have a configured, re-usable data splitter for CSV files that have headers. We need to add this to our pipeline as a filter, so head back to the pipeline's Structure section and add a DSParser, as below. Call it something like CSV splitter filter:\n\nNow we have a pipeline that looks like this:\n\nClick on the CSV splitter filter element and the pane below will show it's properties. We need to tell it to use our newly created CSV splitter. Double click the textConverter property and change Value to the actual CSV splitter:\n\nTest the csv splitter\nSo now we have CSV data in Stroom and a pipeline that is configured to process CSV data. We've done a fair few things so far and are we sure the pipeline is correctly configured? We can do some debugging and find out.\nIn Stroom you can step through you records and see what the output is at each stage. It's easy to start doing this. The first thing to do is to open your CSV_FEED feed, then click the big blue stepping button at the bottom right:\n\nYou'll be asked to select a pipeline:\n\nNow you get a view that's similar to your feed view, except it also shows the pipeline:\n\nIt also has stepping controls. Click the green step forward icon (). You should see something like this:\n\nGreat! If you don't see this then there's something wrong. Click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code and hopefully some errors. Some issues might be: did you remember to import the data splitter schema into Stroom? Did you remember to confgure the Text Converter to be a Data Splitter? \nIf everything went fine then click the step forward button a few more times and you'll see the yellow selection move down as you process each row.\nWhat we actually want to see is the output from the Text Converter, so click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code we entered earlier and below two panes, one containing the CSV and one containing the split-up text, in XML form:\n\nSo here we have some XML in a basic format we call the records format. You can see the schema for records in the XML schemas folder.\nAdd XSLT to transform records format XML into something else\nCreate the XSLT filter\nThis process is very similar to creating the CSV splitter: \n\nCreate the XSLT filter\nAdd it to the pipeline \nStep through to make sure it's doing what we expect\n\nCreate the XSLT filter, calling it something like XSLT:\n\nOn the new tab click on XSLT. This is another big text field but this one accepts XSLT. This one will be very basic and just takes the split up data and puts it into fields. The XSLT for this is below but if you'd like to tinker then go ahead.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMake sure you save it.\nGo back to the Structure section of the pipeline and add an XSLTFilter element. Call it something like XSLT filter. \n\nSelect the XSLT filter and configure it to use the actual XSLT you just created by double-clicking xslt in the properties:\n\nIn the dialog make sure the value is the XSLT filter. Save the pipeline.\nTest the XSLT filter\nWe're going to test this in the same way we tested the CSV splitter, by clicking the big blue button on the feed. Click the step forward button () a few times to make sure it's working then click on the XSLT element. This time you should see the XSLT filter there too, as well as the basic XML being transformed into more useful XML:\n\nFantastic! Data converted! Well done if you've got this far. Really, there are lots of steps and things that could go wrong and you've persevered. There's a few more things to get this pipeline ready for doing this task for real. We need to get this data to a destination.\nOutputting the transformed data\nCreate the XML writer\nWhat's an XML Writer and why do you need one? The XSLT filter doesn't actually write XML but instead just passes XML events from one filter to another. In order to write XML out you need an XML writer. You don't need to create one outside the pipeline (in the way you did with the CSV splitter and the XSLT filter). An XML writer is just added to the pipeline like this:\n\nThat's it, no other configuration necessary.\nCreate the destination\nWe need to do something with the serialised XML. We'll write it to a stream. To do this we create a stream appender:\n\nUnlike the Source element this element needs to be configured. We need to configure two things: the streamType and the destination feed. \nSetting the feed\nWe'll send the output to the CSV_FEED - all data associated with this feed will be in the same place. To do that we edit the feed property and set it to CSV_FEED:\n\nWe also need to edit the streamType property:We set the streamType to Events:\n\n\nThat's it! Our pipeline is configured! \nTest the destination\nWe can test the XML writer and the streamAppender using the same stepping feature. Make sure you've saved the pipeline and set a new stepping session running. If you click on the stream appender you'll see something like this:\n\nSet the pipeline running\nObviously you don't want to step through your data one by one. This all needs automation, and this is what Processors are for. The processor works in the background to take any unprocessed data from a feed and put it through a pipeline. So far everything on our EXAMPLE_IN feed is unprocessed. \nCreate a processor\nProcessors are created from the Processors section of the pipeline:\n\nClick the add button  and configure the huge dialog. You only need to set the incoming feed and the stream types:\n(\nNow you'll see a very wide table looking something like this:\n\nThis shows two things:\n\nThe processor for the pipeline\nThe filter that determines what data is passed to the processor\n\nIf you scroll all the way over to the right you'll see the Enabled checkbox:\n\nCheck enabled for the processor and the filter you've just created. This is it, everything we've done is about to start working on its own, just like it would in a real configuration.\nIf you keep refreshing this table it will show you the processing status which should change after a few seconds to show that the data you have uploaded is being or has been processed. Once this has happened you should be able to open the destination feed and see the output data (or errors if there were any).\n\nYou can see that there are the Raw Events and the processed Events. If you click on the Events then you can see all the XML that we've produced.\nTroubleshooting\nIf nothing happens you might need to enable stream processing. This was explained earlier.\nNow you've processed your data you can go ahead and index it.\n"},"quick-start-guide/index/":{"url":"quick-start-guide/index/","title":"Indexing the data","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Quick-Start Guide - Indexing\nBefore you can visualise your data with dashboards you have to index the data;\nFirst I opted for creating a specific volume to hold my data, just because I wanted to keep my shards away from the default volumes;\nGo to the Tools ➔ Volumes menu\n\nOnce the volumes dialogue opens click the blue plus sign at the top left of the window to add a new one\n\nSelect the node where you want the volume to be and the path you want to create, (because we are following the quick-start guide we just have one node and limited size, but we do want it to active so we can write documents to it and we want it to be public, because we might want other indexes to use it; your needs might be different.\n\nClick ok and we’re good to go.\nThen we can create an index by selecting index item in the explorer tree.

Stroom performs better if you use most of the servers memory so change the maximum memory setting (Xmx) accordingly, e.g. -Xmx40g will use 40 GB.\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC_CLASSNAME, STROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC URL, STROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB USERNAME, STROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB PASSWORD - MySQL connection details for the statistics database\n\nRunning\nStart the configured instance:\n./bin/start.sh\n\nInspect the logs:\ntail -f instance/logs/stroom.log\n\nOther things to configure:\nYou might want to configure some of the following:\n\nProcessing User Setup\nMySQL Server Setup\nJava Key Store Setup\nApache Forwarding\nSecuring Stroom\n\n"},"install-guide/setup/apache-forwarding.html":{"url":"install-guide/setup/apache-forwarding.html","title":"Apache forwarding","keywords":"","body":"Apache Forwarding\nStroom defaults to listening for HTTP on port 8080.\nIt is recommended that Apache is used to listen on the standard HTTP port 80 and forward requests on via the Apache mod_jk module and the AJP protocol (on 8009).\nApache can also perform HTTPS on port 443 and pass over requests to Tomcat using the same AJP protocol.\nIt is additionally recommended that Stroom Proxy is used to front data ingest and so Apache is configured to route traffic to http(s)://server/stroom/datafeed to Stroom Proxy and anything else to Stroom.\nPrerequisites\n\ntomcat-connectors-1.2.31-src.tar.gz\n\nSetup Apache\n\nAs root\nPatch mod_jk\n\ncd ~/tmp\ntar -xvzf tomcat-connectors-1.2.31-src.tar.gz \ncd tomcat-connectors-1.2.31-src/native\n./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \nmake\nsudo cp apache-2.0/mod_jk.so /etc/httpd/modules/\ncd\n\n\nPut the web server cert, private key, and CA cert into the web servers conf directory  /etc/httpd/conf.

Note that this is the var Stroom looks for, not the var as set in the stack, so you'll find it in the stack YAML.\nAre your certs configured properly?

You also need to check all of the nodes are enabled that you want to take part in processing or any other jobs.\nKeep refreshing the table until all nodes show healthy pings as above. If you do not get ping results for each node then they are not configured correctly.\nOnce a cluster is configured correctly you will get proper distribution of processing tasks and search will be able to access all nodes to take part in a distributed query.\n"},"user-guide/volumes.html":{"url":"user-guide/volumes.html","title":"Volumes","keywords":"","body":"Volumes\nTODO: Describe volumes\n"},"user-guide/tasks.html":{"url":"user-guide/tasks.html","title":"Tasks","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Tasks\nThere are various tasks that run in the background within Stroom. Among these are tasks that control pipeline processing, removing old files from the file system, checking the status of nodes and volumes etc. Each task executes at a different time depending on the purpose of the task. There are three ways that a task can be executed:\n\nScheduled tasks execute periodically according to a cron schedule. These include tasks such as cleaning the file system where Stroom only needs to perform this action once a day and can do so overnight.\nFrequency controlled tasks are executed every X seconds, minutes, hours etc. Most of the tasks that execute with a given frequency are status checking tasks that perform a short lived action fairly frequently.\nDistributed tasks are only applicable to stream processing with a pipeline. Distributed tasks are executed by a worker node as soon as a worker has available threads to execute a tasks and the task distributor has work available.\n\nA list of task types and their execution method can be seen by opening 'Monitoring/Jobs' from the main menu.\n TODO image\nExpanding each task type allows you to configure how a task behaves on each node:\n TODO image\nStream Task Retention\nHow frequently we try and delete completed stream tasks older than system property \n(stroom.streamTaskDeleteAge)\nProxy Aggregation\nIf you front Stroom with an Stroom proxy which is configured to 'store' rather\nthan 'store/forward', then this task when run will pick up all files in the proxy \nrepository dir, aggregate them by feed and bring them into Stroom.\n(It uses the system property stroom.proxyDir)\nFile System Clean\nWhen you delete a stream in Stroom it only marks the database entry for the stream as deleted.\nThis is so deletes are instant as far as the user is concerned as it could take a while to \ndelete data from the disk. The task when run deletes files on disk and database entries for \nstreams that are marked as deleted. We don\\u2019t have this feature turned on in production \nso that we can restore accidentally deleted items by making a manual update in the DB. It \nonly needs to be run if you want to permanently delete files and free up storage.\nStream Retention\nWhen feeds have a stream retention period set to anything other than 'Forever', \nthis task when run will cycle around all feeds and mark streams as deleted that are older \nthan the specified retention period.\nStream Delete\nHow frequently we physically delete streams that have been logically deleted based the age of the delete \n(stroom.streamDeletePurgeAge)\nStream Attributes Retention\nHow frequently we try and delete attributes older than system property \n(stroom.streamAttributeDatabaseAge).\nSQL Stats Database Aggregation\nHow frequently we try and aggregate stats on the database.\nIf this job is enabled on a number of nodes only one will actually perform the aggregation on the database.\nNode Status\nHow frequently we try write stats about node status including JVM and memory usage.\nCluster Lock Keep Alive\nHow frequently we issue our keep alive for cluster locks.\nIndex Shard Retention\nLogically delete index shards that are older than the retention period set on their associated index.\nPhysically deletes index shard data on disk and associated DB entry.\nRefreshes index field data for indexing purposes.\nProperty Cache Reload\nHow frequently we invalidate the system property cache and reload from the database.\nVolume Status Retention\nHow frequently we try and delete old volume status information.\nVolume Status\nScans your volumes to ensure they are available and determines how much free space they have.\nRecords this status in the Volume Status table.\nDisable Unused Accounts\nHow frequently we check the system property stroom.daysToUnusedAccountExpiry to check and disable\nunused accounts.\nPipeline Destination Roll\nHow frequently we check pipeline destination's to roll (age off and start a new one).\nThis period is controlled in the pipeline.\nBenchmark System\nUsed to benchmark the performance of an Stroom cluster. To use this task you need to stop\nreceiving data so that the results are skewed by processing data other than benchmark data. \nWe only run this task in our reference environment to ensure that each version of Stroom\nmaintains or improves upon the processing performance of previous versions.\nStream Processor\nDistributes stream tasks to worker nodes for processing.

This could be the name of a project/service or capability.\n\nEnvironment - A means to identify the deployed instance of a system. This may indicate the deployment status, e.g. DEV, REF, LIVE, OPS, etc., and/or the location where the instance is deployed. An environment may be a combination of these attributes separated with an underscore.\n\nFeed - The name of the feed this data relates to. This is mandatory and must match a feed defined within Stroom in order for Stroom to accept the data and know what to do with it.\n\nCompression - This token is optionally used when the POST payload is compressed with either gzip of zip compression. Value of ZIP and GZIP are valid. Note: The Compression token MUST not be used in conjunction with the standard HTTP header token Content-Encoding otherwise stroom will be unable to un-compress the data. Use either Compression:GZIP or Content-Encoding:gzip, not both. Using Compression is preferred.\n\nEffectiveTime - This is only applicable to reference data. It is used to indicate the point in time that the reference data is applicable to, i.e. all event data that uses the reference data that is created after the effective time will use the reference data until a new reference data item arrives with a later effective time.

The code for the clients is in the stroom-clients repository stroom-clients.\nUsing Docker\nstroom-log-sender is a small Docker image for sending data to stroom. \nThis is the simplest way to get data into stroom if the data provider is itself running in docker. \nIt can also be used for sending data to stroom from data providers that are not running in Docker.\nstroom-log-sender makes use of the send_to_stroom.sh bash script that is described below.\nFor details on how to use stroom-log-sender, see the Dockerhub link above.\nUNIX (using send_to_stroom.sh)\nsend_to_stroom.sh is a small bash script to make it easier to send data to stroom. To use it download the following files using wget or similar, replacing SEND_TO_STROOM_VER with the latest released version from here:\nSEND_TO_STROOM_VER=\"send-to-stroom-v2.0\" && \\\n    wget \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gchq/stroom-clients/${SEND_TO_STROOM_VER}/bash/send_to_stroom.sh\" && \\\n    wget \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gchq/stroom-clients/${SEND_TO_STROOM_VER}/bash/send_to_stroom_args.sh\" && \\\n    chmod u+x send_to_stroom*.sh\n\nTo see the help for send_to_stroom.sh, enter ./send_to_stroom.sh --help\nThe following is an example of using send_to_stroom.sh to send all logs in a directory:\n./send_to_stroom.sh \\\n    --delete-after-sending \\\n    --file-regex \".*/access-[0-9]+.*\\.log(\\.gz)?$\" \\\n    --key ./client..key \\\n    --cert ./client.pem.crt \\\n    --cacert ./ca.pem.crt \\\n    /some_directory/logs \\\n    MY_FEED \\\n    MY_SYSTEM \\\n    DEV \\\n    https://stroom-host/stroom/datafeed\n\nUNIX (using curl)\nCurl is a standard unix tool to send data to or from a server. In the following examples -H is used to specify the header arguments required by Stroom, see Header Arguments.\nNotes:\n\nThe @ character must be used in front of the file being posted. If it is not then curl will post the file name instead of it's contents.\nThe --data-binary argument must always be used even for text formats, in order to prevent data corruption by curl stripping out newlines.\n\nExample HTTPS post without authentication:\ncurl -k --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nIn the above example -k is required to stop curl from authenticating the server. The next example must be used to supply the necessary CA to authenticate the server if this is required.\nExample HTTPS With 1 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA. The CA is provided to curl using the '--cacert root_ca.crt' parameter.\nFor step by step instructions for creating, configuring and testing the PKI authentication, see the SSL Guide\nExample HTTPS With 2 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example both verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA and also provides a certificate to authenticate itself with Stroom. The data provider provides a certificate using the '--cert example.pem' parameter.\nIf your input file is not compressed you should compress it as follows:\ngzip -c uncompressedfile.dat | curl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @- \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n            -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n            -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n            -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n            -H \"Compression:Gzip\"\n\nWhen delivering data from a RHEL4 host, an additional header argument must be added to specify the FQDN of the host:\n-H \"Hostname:host.being.audited\"\n\nThe hostname being sent as a header argument may be resolved upon execution using the command hostname -f.\nSSL Notes\nTo create a .pem format key simply append the private key and certifcate.\ncat .key >> .pem\ncat .crt >> .pem\n\nTo remove the pass phrase from a openssl private key use.\nopenssl rsa -in server.key -out server-clear.key\n\nThe send-logs.sh script assumes the period start and end times are embedded in the file name (e.g. log_2010-01-01T12:00:00.000Z_2010-01-02T12:00:00.000Z.log).  The certificates will need to be added to the script as above.\nWindows\nUsing wget\nThere is a version of wget for windows\n\nUse --post-file argument to supply the data\nUse --certificate and --certificate-type arguments to specify your client certificate\nUse --header argument to inform Stroom which feed and environment your data relates to\n\nUsing curl\nThere is a version of curl for Windows\nNote: We haven't tried using this so if anybody would like to have a go and provide documentation for this section please do.\nUsing VBScript\nextract-data.vbs uses wevtutil.exe to extract Security event information from the windows event log.  This script has been tested on Windows 2008.\nThis script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes).  The first time the script is run it stores the current time in UTC format in the registry.  Subsequent calls then extract event information from the last run time to the new current time.  The events are stored in a zip file with the period dates embedded.\nThe script requires a working directory used as a buffer for the zip files.  This can be set at the start of the script otherwise it will default to the working directory.\nThe send-data.vbs script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes). The script will scan for zip files and send them to Stroom.\nThe script details several parameters that require setting per environment. Among these are the working directory that the zip files are stored in, the feed name and the URL of Stroom.\nSSL\nTo send data over SSL (https) you must import a client certificate in p12 format into windows.To convert a certificate (.crt) and private key (.key) into a p12 format use the following command:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in .crt -inkey .key -out .p12 -name \"\"\n\nOnce in p12 format use the windows certificate wizard to import the public private key.\nThe send-data-tree.vbs script works through a directory for different feed types.  \nUsing Java\nThe stroom-java-client provides an example Java client that can:\n\nRead a zip, gzip or uncompressed an input file.\nPerform a HTTP post of data with zip, gzip or uncompressed compression.\nPass down arguments on the command line as HTTP request arguments.\nSupports HTTP and HTTPS with 1 or 2 way authentication.\n\n(N.B. arguments must be in lower case).\nTo use the example client first compile the Java code:\njavac DataFeedClient.java\n\nExample HTTP Post:\njava -classpath . DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=http:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nExample HTTPS With 1 way SSL authentication:\njava -classpath . -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=ca.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=capass DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=https:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nExample HTTPS With 2 way SSL authentication:\njava -classpath . -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=ca.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=capass -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=example.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword= DataFeedClient inputfile=datafeed url=https:///stroom/datafeed system=EXAMPLE-SYSTEM environment=DEV feed=EXAMPLE-FEED\n\nUsing C#\nThe StroomCSharpClient is a C# port of the Java client and behaves in the same way.

Relative time expressions create a date time that is relative to the execution time of the query. Supported expressons are as follows:\n\nnow() - The current execution time of the query.\n\nsecond() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest second.\n\nminute() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest minute.\n\nhour() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest hour.\n\nday() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the nearest day.\n\nweek() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the first day of the week (Monday).\n\nmonth() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the start of the current month.\n\nyear() - The current execution time of the query rounded down to the start of the current year.\n\n\nAdding\\/Subtracting Durations\nWith relative times it is possible to add or subtract durations so that queries can be constructed to provide for example, the last week of data, the last hour of data etc.\nTo add\\/subtract a duration from a query term the duration is simply appended after the relative time, e.g.\nnow() + 2d\nMultiple durations can be combined in the expression, e.g.\nnow() + 2d - 10h\nnow() + 2w - 1d10h\nDurations consist of a number and duration unit. Supported duration units are:\n\ns - Seconds\n\nm - Minutes\n\nh - Hours\n\nd - Days\n\nw - Weeks\n\nM - Months\n\ny - Years\n\n\nUsing these durations a query to get the last weeks data could be as follows:\nbetween now() - 1w and now()\nOr midnight a week ago to midnight today:\nbetween day() - 1w and day()\nOr if you just wanted data for the week so far:\ngreater than week()\nOr all data for the previous year:\nbetween year() - 1y and year()\nOr this year so far:\ngreater than year()\n"},"user-guide/dashboards/dictionaries.html":{"url":"user-guide/dashboards/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nCreating\nRight click on a folder in the explorer tree that you want to create a dictionary in.

This storage could be a CIFS, NFS or similar shared file system. It is recommended that access to this shared storage is protected so that only the application can access it. This could be achieved by placing the storage and application behind a firewall and by requiring appropriate authentication to the shared storage. It should be noted that NFS is unauthenticated so should be used with appropriate safeguards.\nMySQL\nAccounts\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to discuss this in detail but all MySQL accounts should be secured on initial install. Official guidance for doing this can be found here.\nCommunication\nCommunication between MySQL and the application should be secured. This can be achieved in one of the following ways:\n\nPlacing MySQL and the application behind a firewall\nSecuring communication through the use of iptables\nMaking MySQL and the application communicate over SSL (see here for instructions)\n\nThe above options are not mutually exclusive and may be combined to better secure communication.\nApplication\nNode to node communication\nIn a multi node Stroom deployment each node communicates with the master node. This can be configured securely in one of several ways:\n\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8080 - Secured by being behind a firewall or using iptables\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8443 - Secured using SSL and certificates\nRemoval of Tomcat connectors other than AJP and configuration of Apache to communicate on port 443 using SSL and certificates\n\nApplication to Stroom Proxy Communication\nThe application can be configured to share some information with Stroom Proxy so that Stroom Proxy can decide whether or not to accept data for certain feeds based on the existence of the feed or it's reject/accept status. The amount of information shared between the application and the proxy is minimal but could be used to discover what feeds are present within the system. Securing this communication is harder as both the application and the proxy will not typically reside behind the same firewall. Despite this communication can still be performed over SSL thus protecting this potential attack vector.\nAdmin port\nStroom (v6 and above) and its associated family of stroom-* DropWizard based services all expose an admin port (8081 in the case of stroom). This port serves up various health check and monitoring pages as well as a number of restful services for initiating admin tasks. There is currently no authentication on this admin port so it is assumed that access to this port will be tightly controlled using a firewall, iptables or similar.\nServlets\nThere are several servlets in Stroom that are accessible by certain URLs. Considerations should be made about what URLs are made available via Apache and who can access them. The servlets, path and function are described below:\n\n\n\nServlet\nPath\nFunction\nRisk\n\n\n\n\nDataFeed\n/datafeed or /datafeed/*\nUsed to receive data\nPossible denial of service attack by posting too much data/noise\n\n\nRemoteFeedService\n/remoting/remotefeedservice.rpc\nUsed by proxy to ask application about feed status (described in previous section)\nPossible to systematically discover which feeds are available. Communication with this service should be secured over SSL discussed above\n\n\nDynamicCSSServlet\n/stroom/dynamic.css\nServes dynamic CSS based on theme configuration\nLow risk as no important data is made available by this servlet\n\n\nDispatchService\n/stroom/dispatch.rpc\nService for UI and server communication\nAll back-end services accessed by this umbrella service are secured appropriately by the application\n\n\nImportFileServlet\n/stroom/importfile.rpc\nUsed during configuration upload\nUsers must be authenticated and have appropriate permissions to import configuration\n\n\nScriptServlet\n/stroom/script\nServes user defined visualisation scripts to the UI\nThe visualisation script is considered to be part of the application just as the CSS so is not secured\n\n\nClusterCallService\n/clustercall.rpc\nUsed for node to node communication as discussed above\nCommunication must be secured as discussed above\n\n\nExportConfig\n/export/*\nServlet used to export configuration data\nServlet access must be restricted with Apache to prevent configuration data being made available to unauthenticated users\n\n\nStatus\n/status\nShows the application status including volume usage\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see the application status\n\n\nEcho\n/echo\nBlock GZIP data posted to the echo servlet is sent back uncompressed. This is a utility servlet for decompression of external data\nURL should be secured or not made available\n\n\nDebug\n/debug\nServlet for echoing HTTP header arguments including certificate details\nShould be secured in production environments\n\n\nSessionList\n/sessionList\nLists the logged in users\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see who is logged in\n\n\nSessionResourceStore\n/resourcestore/*\nUsed to create, download and delete temporary files liked to a users session such as data for export\nThis is secured by using the users session and requiring authentication\n\n\n\nHDFS, Kafka, HBase, Zookeeper\nStroom and stroom-stats can integrate with HDFS, Kafka, HBase and Zookeeper. It should be noted that communication with these external services is currently not secure. Until additional security measures (e.g. authentication) are put in place it is assumed that access to these services will be careful controlled (using a firewall, iptables or similar) so that only stroom nodes can access the open ports.\nContent\nIt may be possible for a user to write XSLT, Data Splitter or other content that may expose data that we do not wish to or to cause the application some harm. At present processing operations are not isolated processes and so it is easy to cripple processing performance with a badly written translation whether written accidentally or on purpose. To mitigate this risk it is recommended that users that are given permission to create XSLT, Data Splitter and Pipeline configurations are trusted to do so.\nVisualisations can be completely customised with javascript. The javascript that is added is executed in a clients browser potentially opening up the possibility of XSS attacks, an attack on the application to access data that a user shouldn't be able to access, an attack to destroy data or simply failure/incorrect operation of the user interface. To mitigate this risk all user defined javascript is executed within a separate browser IFrame. In addition all javascript should be examined before being added to a production system unless the author is trusted. This may necessitate the creation of a separate development and testing environment for user content.\n"},"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html":{"url":"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nData Splitter was created to transform text into XML. The XML produced is basic but can be processed further with XSLT to form any desired XML output.\nData Splitter works by using regular expressions to match a region of content or tokenizers to split content. The whole match or match group can then be output or passed to other expressions to further divide the matched data.\nThe root  element controls the way content is read and buffered from the source. It then passes this content on to one or more child expressions that attempt to match the content. The child expressions attempt to match content one at a time in the order they are specified until one matches. The matching expression then passes the content that it has matched to other elements that either emit XML or apply other expressions to the content matched by the parent.\nThis process of content supply, match, (supply, match)*, emit is best illustrated in a simple CSV example.

Each of these elements can be categorised as one of the following:\n\nContent provider\nExpression\nVariable\nOutput\n\n"},"datasplitter/2-1-content-providers.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-1-content-providers.html","title":"Content providers","keywords":"","body":"Content Providers\nContent providers take some content from the input source or elsewhere (see fixed strings and provide it to one or more expressions. Both the root element  and  elements are content providers.\nRoot element \nThe root element of a Data Splitter configuration is . It supplies content from the input source to one or more expressions defined within it. The way that content is buffered is controlled by the root element and the way that errors are handled as a result of child expressions not matching all of the content it supplies.\nAttributes\nThe following attributes can be added to the  root element:\n\nignoreErrors\nbufferSize\n\nignoreErrors\nData Splitter generates errors if not all of the content is matched by the regular expressions beneath the  or within  elements. The error messages are intended to aid the user in writing good Data Splitter configurations. The intent is to indicate when the input data is not being matched fully and therefore possibly skipping some important data. Despite this, in some cases it is laborious to have to write expressions to match all content. In these cases it is preferable to add this attribute to ignore these errors. However it is often better to write expressions that capture all of the supplied content and discard unwanted characters. This attribute also affects errors generated by the use of the minMatch attribute on  which is described later on.\nTake the following example input:\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis could be matched with the following configuration:\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above configuration would only match up to a comment for each record line, e.g.\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis may well be the desired functionality but if there was useful content within the comment it would be lost. Because of this Data Splitter warns you when expressions are failing to match all of the content presented so that you can make sure that you aren’t missing anything important. In the above example it is obvious that this is the required behaviour but in more complex cases you might be otherwise unaware that your expressions were losing data.\nTo maintain this assurance that you are handling all content it is usually best to write expressions to explicitly match all content even though you may do nothing with some matches, e.g.\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above example would match all of the content and would therefore not generate warnings. Sub-expressions of 'body' could use match group 1 and ignore the comment.\nHowever as previously stated it might often be difficult to write expressions that will just match content that is to be discarded. In these cases ignoreErrors can be used to suppress errors caused by unmatched content.\nbufferSize (Advanced)\nThis is an optional attribute used to tune the size of the character buffer used by Data Splitter. The default size is 20000 characters and should be fine for most translations. The minimum value that this can be set to is 20000 characters and the maximum is 1000000000. The only reason to specify this attribute is when individual records are bigger than 10000 characters which is rarely the case.\nGroup element \nGroups behave in a similar way to the root element in that they provide content for one or more inner expressions to deal with, e.g.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nAttributes\nAs the  element is a content provider it also includes the same 'ignoreErrors' attribute which behaves in the same way. The complete list of attributes for the  element is as follows:\n\nid\nvalue\nignoreErrors\nmatchOrder\nreverse\n\nid\nWhen Data Splitter reports errors it outputs an XPath to describe the part of the configuration that generated the error, e.g.\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nIt is often a little difficult to identify the configuration element that generated the error by looking at the path and the element description, particularly when multiple elements are the same, e.g. many  elements without attributes. To make identification easier you can add an 'id' attribute to any element in the configuration resulting in error descriptions as follows:\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nvalue\nThis attribute determines what content to present to child expressions. By default the entire content matched by a group’s parent expression is passed on by the group to child expressions. If required, content from a specific match group in the parent expression can be passed to child expressions using the value attribute, e.g. value=\"$1\". In addition to this content can be composed in the same way as it is for data names and values. see match references for a full description of match references.\nignoreErrors\nThis behaves in the same way as for the root element.\nmatchOrder\nThis is an optional attribute used to control how content is consumed by expression matches. Content can be consumed in sequence or in any order using matchOrder=\"sequence\" or matchOrder=\"any\". If the attribute is not specified, Data Splitter will default to matching in sequence.\nWhen matching in sequence, each match consumes some content and the content position is moved beyond the match ready for the subsequent match. However, in some cases the order of these constructs is not predictable, e.g. we may sometimes be presented with:\nValue1=1 Value2=2\n… or sometimes with:\nValue2=2 Value1=1\nUsing a sequential match order the following example would work to find both values in Value1=1 Value2=2\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\n… but this example would skip over Value2 and only find the value of Value1 if the input was Value2=2 Value1=1.\nTo be able to deal with content that contains these constructs in either order we need to change the match order to any.\nWhen matching in any order, each match removes the matched section from the content rather than moving the position past the match so that all remaining content can be matched by subsequent expressions. In the following example the first expression would match and remove Value1=1 from the supplied content and the second expression would be presented with Value2=2 which it could also match.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nIf the attribute is omitted by default the match order will be sequential. This is the default behaviour as tokens are most often in sequence and consuming content in this way is more efficient as content does not need to be copied by the parser to chop out sections as is required for matching in any order. It is only necessary to use this feature when fields that are identifiable with a specific match can occur in any order.\nreverse\nOccasionally it is desirable to reverse the content presented by a group to child expressions. This is because it is sometimes easier to form a pattern by matching content in reverse.\nTake the following example content of name, value pairs delimited by = but with no spaces between names, multiple spaces between values and only a space between subsequent pairs:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 location=loc1 A user=An end user serverName=bigserver\nWe could write a pattern that matches each name value pair by matching up to the start of the next name, e.g.\n\nThis would match the following:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=\nHere we are capturing the name and value for each pair in separate groups but the pattern has to also match the name from the next name value pair to find the end of the value. By default Data Splitter will move the content buffer to the end of the match ready for subsequent matches so the next name will not be available for matching.\nIn addition to matching too much content the above example also uses a reluctant qualifier .+?. Use of reluctant qualifiers almost always impacts performance so they are to be avoided if at all possible.\nA better way to match the example content is to match the input in reverse, reading characters from right to left.\nThe following example demonstrates this:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nUsing the reverse attribute on the parent group causes content to be supplied to all child expressions in reverse order. In the above example this allows the pattern to match values followed by names which enables us to cope with the fact that values have multiple spaces but names have no spaces.\nContent is only presented to child regular expressions in reverse. When referencing values from match groups the content is returned in the correct order, e.g. the above example would return:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reverse feature isn't needed very often but there are a few cases where it really helps produce the desired output without the complexity and performance overhead of a reluctant match.\nAn alternative to using the reverse attribute is to use the original reluctant expression example but tell Data Splitter to make the subsequent name available for the next match by not advancing the content beyond the end of the previous value. This is done by using the advance attribute on the . However, the reverse attribute represents a better way to solve this particular problem and allows a simpler and more efficient regular expression to be used.\n"},"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html","title":"Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Expressions\nExpressions match some data supplied by a parent content provider.

In addition to this it is possible to specify characters that are used to escape the delimiter as well as characters that contain or \"quote\" a value that may include the delimiter sequence but allow it to be ignored.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\ndelimiter\nescape\ncontainerStart\ncontainerEnd\nmaxMatch\nminMatch\nonlyMatch\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\ndelimiter\nA required attribute used to specify the character string that will be used as a delimiter to split the supplied content unless it is preceded by an escape character or within a container if specified. Several of the previous examples use this attribute.\nescape\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that is used to escape the delimiter. Many delimited text formats have an escape character that is used to tell any parser that the following delimiter should be ignored, e.g. often a character such as '\\' is used to escape the character that follows it so that it is not treated as a delimiter. When specified this escape sequence also applies to any container characters that may be specified.\ncontainerStart\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression ignore the presence of delimiters until an end container is found. If the character is preceded by the specified escape sequence then this container sequence will be ignored and the expression will continue matching characters up to a delimiter.\nIf used containerEnd must also be specified. If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\ncontainerEnd\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression stop ignoring the presence of delimiters if it believes it is currently in a container. If the character is preceded by the specified escape sequence then this container sequence will be ignored and the expression will continue matching characters while ignoring the presence of any delimiter.\nIf used containerStart must also be specified. If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\nmaxMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the maximum number of times this expression is allowed to match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then the Data Splitter will keep matching the supplied content until it reaches the end. If specified Data Splitter will stop matching the supplied content when it has matched it the specified number of times.\nThis attribute is used in the 'CSV with header line' example to ensure that only the first line is treated as a header line.\nminMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the minimum number of times this expression should match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then Data Splitter will not enforce that the expression matches the supplied content. If specified Data Splitter will generate an error if the expression does not match the supplied content at least as many times as specified.\nUnlike maxMatch, minMatch does not control the matching process but instead controls the production of error messages generated if the parser is not seeing the expected input.\nonlyMatch\nOptional attribute to use this expression only for specific instances of a match of the parent expression, e.g. on the 4th, 5th and 8th matches of the parent expression specified by '4,5,8'. This is used when this expression should only be used to subdivide content from certain parent matches.\nThe  element\nThe  element directs Data Splitter to match content using the specified regular expression pattern. In addition to this the same match control attributes that are available on the  element are also present as well as attributes to alter the way the pattern works.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\npattern\ndotAll\ncaseInsensitive\nmaxMatch\nminMatch\nonlyMatch\nadvance\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\npattern\nThis is a required attribute used to specify a regular expression to use to match on the supplied content. The pattern is used to match the content multiple times until the end of the content is reached while the maxMatch and onlyMatch conditions are satisfied.\ndotAll\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the use of '.' in the supplied pattern matches all characters including new lines. If 'true' '.' will match all characters including new lines, if 'false' it will only match up to a new line. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will only match up to a new line.\nThis attribute is used in many of the multiline examples above.\ncaseInsensitive\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the supplied pattern should match content in a case insensitive way. If 'true' the expression will match content in a case insensitive manner, if 'false' it will match the content in a case sensitive manner. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will match the content in a case sensitive manner.\nmaxMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see maxMatch.\nminMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see minMatch.\nonlyMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see onlyMatch.\nadvance\nAfter an expression has matched content in the buffer, the buffer start position is advanced so that it moves to the end of the entire match. This means that subsequent expressions operating on the content buffer will not see the previously matched content again. This is normally required behaviour, but in some cases some of the content from a match is still required for subsequent matches. Take the following example of name value pairs:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nThe first name value pair could be matched with the following expression:\n\n\nThe above expression would match as follows:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nIn this example we have had to do a reluctant match to extract the value in group 2 and not include the subsequent name. Because the reluctant match requires us to specify what we are reluctantly matching up to, we have had to include an expression after it that matches the next name.\nBy default the parser will move the character buffer to the end of the entire match so the next expression will be presented with the following:\nsome value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will have been lost from the content buffer and will not be available for matching.\nThis behaviour can be altered by telling the expression how far to advance the character buffer after matching. This is done with the advance attribute and is used to specify the match group whose end position should be treated as the point the content buffer should advance to, e.g.\n\n\nIn this example the content buffer will only advance to the end of match group 2 and subsequent expressions will be presented with the following content:\nname2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will still be available in the content buffer.\nIt is likely that the advance feature will only be useful in cases where a reluctant match is performed. Reluctant matches are discouraged for performance reasons so this feature should rarely be used. A better way to tackle the above example would be to present the content in reverse, however this is only possible if the expression is within a group, i.e. is not a root expression. There may also be more complex cases where reversal is not an option and the use of a reluctant match is the only option.\nThe  element\nThe  element matches the entire content of the parent group and makes it available to child groups or  elements. The purpose of  is to act as a catch all expression to deal with content that is not handled by a more specific expression, e.g. to output some other unknown, unrecognised or unexpected data.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThe  element provides the same functionality as using .* as a pattern in a  element and where dotAll is set to true, e.g. .

In addition to this a match group number may be added to just retrieve part of the expression match.

However there are various match groups that can be used by child  and  elements to reference sections of the matched content.\nTo illustrate the content provided by each match group, take the following example:\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\", \"This is the next text\"\nAnd the following  element:\n\n\nThe match groups are as follows:\n\n$ or $0: The entire content that is matched including the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\",\n\n$1: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\"\n\n$2: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and filtered to remove escape characters (more expensive than $1)\n\n\"This is some text, that we wish to match\"\nIn addition to this behaviour match groups 1 and 2 will omit outermost whitespace and container characters if specified, e.g. with the following content:\n\"  This is some text\\, that we wish to match  \"  , \"This is the next text\"\nAnd the following  element:\n\n\nThe match groups are as follows:\n\n$ or $0: The entire content that is matched including the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"  This is some text\\, that we wish to match  \"  ,\n\n$1: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and strips outer containers.\n\nThis is some text\\, that we wish to match\n\n$2: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and strips outer containers and filtered to remove escape characters (more computationally expensive than $1)\n\nThis is some text, that we wish to match\nReferences to  Match Groups\nLike the  element various match groups can be referenced in a  expression to retrieve portions of matched content.

Each variable must have a unique id so that it can be referenced. References to variables have the form $VARIABLE_ID$, e.g.\n\n\nIdentification\nData Splitter validates the configuration on load and ensures that all element ids are unique and that referenced ids belong to a variable.\nA variable will only store data if it is referenced so variables that are not referenced will do nothing. In addition to this a variable will only store data for match groups that are referenced, e.g. if $heading$1 is the only reference to a variable with an id of ‘heading’ then only data for match group 1 will be stored for reference lookup.\nScopes\nVariables have two scopes which affect how data is retrieved when referenced:\n\nLocal scope\nRemote scope\n\nLocal Scope\nVariables are local to a reference if the reference exists as a descendant of the variables parent expression, e.g.\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example, matches for the outermost  expression are stored in the variable with the id of line. The only reference to this variable is in a data element that is a descendant of the variables parent expression , i.e. it is nested within split/group/regex.\nBecause the variable is referenced locally only the most recent parent match is relevant, i.e. no retrieval of values by \niteration, iteration offset or fixed position is applicable. These features only apply to remote variables that store multiple values.\nRemote Scope\nThe CSV example with a heading is an example of a variable being referenced from a remote scope.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n      \n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example the parent expression of the variable is not the ancestor of the reference in the  element. This makes the  elements reference to the variable a remote one. In this situation the variable knows that it must store multiple values as the remote reference  may retrieve one of many values from the variable based on:\n\nThe match count of the parent expression.\nThe match count of the parent expression, plus or minus an offset.\nA fixed position in the variable store.\n\nRetrieval of value by iteration\nIn the above example the first line is taken then repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas. This results in multiple values being stored in the ‘heading’ variable. Once this is done subsequent lines are matched and then also repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas in the same way the heading is.\nEach time a line is matched the internal match count of all sub expressions, (e.g. the  expression that is delimited by comma) is reset to 0. Every time the sub  expression matches up to a comma delimiter the match count is incremented. Any references to remote variables will, by default, use the current match count as an index to retrieve one of the many values stored in the variable. This means that the  element in the above example will retrieve the corresponding heading for each value as the match count of the values will match the storage position of each heading.\nRetrieval of value by iteration offset\nIn some cases there may be a mismatch between the position where a value is stored in a variable and the match count applicable when remotely referencing the variable.\nTake the following input:\nBAD,Date,Time,IPAddress,HostName,User,EventType,Detail\n01/01/2010,00:00:00,192.168.1.100,SOMEHOST.SOMEWHERE.COM,user1,logon,\nIn the above example we can see that the first heading ‘BAD’ is not correct for the first value of every line. In this situation we could either adjust the way the heading line is parsed to ignore ‘BAD’ or just adjust the way the heading variable is referenced.\nTo make this adjustment the reference just needs to be told what offset to apply to the current match count to correctly retrieve the stored value. In the above example this would be done like this:\n\n\nThe above reference just uses the match count plus 1 to retrieve the stored value. Any integral offset plus or minus may be used, e.g. [+4] or [-10]. Offsets that result in a position that is outside of the storage range for the variable will not return a value.\nRetrieval of value by fixed position\nIn addition to retrieval by offset from the current match count, a stored value can be returned by a fixed position that has no relevance to the current match count.\nIn the following example the value retrieved from the ‘heading’ variable will always be ‘IPAddress’ as this is the fourth value stored in the ‘heading’ variable and the position index starts at 0.\n\n\n"},"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html":{"url":"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html","title":"Use of fixed strings","keywords":"","body":"Use of fixed strings\nAny  value or  name and value can use references to matched content, but in addition to this it is possible just to output a known string, e.g.\n\n\nThe above example would output somename as the  name attribute.

Following this HOWTO will produce a simple, minimally secured database deployment. In a production environment consideration needs to be made for redundancy, better security, data-store location, increased memory usage, and the like.\nStroom has two databases. The first, stroom, is used for management of Stroom itself and the second, statistics is used for the Stroom Statistics capability. There are many ways to deploy these two databases. One could\n\nhave a single database instance and serve both databases from it\nhave two database instances on the same server and serve one database per instance\nhave two separate nodes, each with it's own database instance\nthe list goes on.\n\nIn this HOWTO, we describe the deployment of two database instances on the one node, each serving a single database. We provide example deployments using either the MariaDB or MySQL Community versions of MySQL.\nAssumptions\n\nwe are installing the MariaDB or MySQL Community RDBMS software.\nthe primary database node is 'stroomdb0.strmdev00.org'.\ninstallation is on a fully patched minimal Centos 7.3 instance.\nwe are installing BOTH databases (stroom and statistics) on the same node - 'stroomdb0.stromdev00.org' but with two distinct database engines. The first database will communicate on port 3307 and the second on 3308.\nwe are deploying with SELinux in enforcing mode.\nany scripts or commands that should run are in code blocks and are designed to allow the user to cut then paste the commands onto their systems.\nin this document, when a textual screen capture is documented, data entry is identified by the data surrounded by '' . This excludes enter/return presses.\n\nInstallation of Software\nMariaDB Server Installation\nAs MariaDB is directly supported by Centos 7, we simply install the database server software and SELinux policy files, as per\nsudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python mariadb-server\n\nMySQL Community Server Installation\nAs MySQL is not directly supported by Centos 7, we need to install it's repository files prior to installation.\nWe get the current MySQL Community release repository rpm and validate it's MD5 checksum against the published value found on the\nMySQL Yum Repository site.\nwget https://repo.mysql.com/mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\nmd5sum mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\n\nOn correct validation of the MD5 checksum, we install the repository files via\nsudo yum -y localinstall mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\n\nNOTE: Stroom currently does not support the latest production MySQL version - 5.7. You will need to install MySQL Version 5.6.\nNow since we must use MySQL Version 5.6 you will need to edit the MySQL repo file /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo to\ndisable the mysql57-community channel and enable the mysql56-community channel. We start by, backing up the repo file with\nsudo cp /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo.ORIG\n\nThen edit the file to change\n...\n# Enable to use MySQL 5.6\n[mysql56-community]\nname=MySQL 5.6 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=0\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n\n[mysql57-community]\nname=MySQL 5.7 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n...\nto become\n...\n# Enable to use MySQL 5.6\n[mysql56-community]\nname=MySQL 5.6 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n\n[mysql57-community]\nname=MySQL 5.7 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=0\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n...\nNext we install server software and SELinux policy files, as per\nsudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python mysql-community-server\n\nPreparing the Database Deployment\nMariaDB Variant\nCreate and instantiate both database instances\nTo set up two MariaDB database instances on the one node, we will use mysql_multi and systemd service templates. The mysql_multi utility is a capability that manages multiple MariaDB databases on the same node and systemd service templates manage multiple services from one configuration file.  A systemd service template is unique in that it has an @ character before the .service suffix.\nTo use this multiple-instance capability, we need to create two data directories for each database instance and also replace the main MariaDB configuration file, /etc/my.cnf, with one that includes configuration of key options for each instance. We will name our instances, mysqld0 and mysqld1. We will also create specific log files for each instance.\nWe will use the directories, /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0 and /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1 for the data directories and /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log and /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log for the log files. Note you should modify /etc/logrotate.d/mariadb to manage these log files. Note also, we need to set the appropriate SELinux file contexts on the created directories and any files.\nWe create the data directories and log files and set their respective SELinux contexts via\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t \"/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0(/.*)?\"\nsudo restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\n\nsudo touch /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\nsudo chcon --reference=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\n\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\nsudo semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t \"/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1(/.*)?\"\nsudo restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\n\nsudo touch /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\nsudo chcon --reference=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\n\nWe now initialise the our two database data directories via\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\n\nWe now replace the  MySQL configuration file to set the options for each instance.

PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!\n\nIn order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current\npassword for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and\nyou haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,\nso you should just press enter here.\n\nEnter current password for root (enter for none): \nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\nSetting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL\nroot user without the proper authorisation.\n\nSet root password? [Y/n] y\nNew password: \nRe-enter new password: \nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\nBy default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone\nto log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for\nthem.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation\ngo a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a\nproduction environment.\n\nRemove anonymous users? [Y/n] \n ...

If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL\ninstallation should now be secure.\n\nThanks for using MySQL!\n\n\nCleaning up...\nthen we execute\nsudo rm /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\nsudo ln /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/mysql.sock /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\nsudo rm /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\nand process as before (for when running mysql_secure_installation). At this both database instances should be secure.\nCreate the Databases and Enable access by the Stroom processing users\nWe now create the stroom database within the first instance, mysqld0 and the statistics database within the second\ninstance mysqld1. It does not matter which database variant used as all commands are the same for both.\nAs well as creating the databases, we also need to establish the Stroom processing users\nthat the Stroom processing nodes will use to access each database.\nFor the stroom database, we will use the database user stroomuser with a password of Stroompassword1@ and for the statistics database, we will use the database user stroomstats with a password of Stroompassword2@. One identifies a processing user as @ on a grant SQL command.\nIn the stroom database instance, we will grant access for\n\nstroomuser@localhost for local access for maintenance etc.\nstroomuser@stroomp00.strmdev00.org for access by processing node stroomp00.strmdev00.org\nstroomuser@stroomp01.strmdev00.org for access by processing node stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nand in the statistics database instance, we will grant access for\n\nstroomstats@localhost for local access for maintenance etc.\nstroomstats@stroomp00.strmdev00.org for access by processing node stroomp00.strmdev00.org\nstroomstats@stroomp01.strmdev00.org for access by processing node stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nThus for the stroom database we execute\nmysql --user=root --port=3307 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0/mysql.sock --password\n\nand on entering the administrator's password, we arrive at the MariaDB [(none)]> or mysql> prompt. At this we create the database with\ncreate database stroom;\n\nand then to establish the users, we execute\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@localhost identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp00.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp01.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\n\nthen\nquit;\n\nto exit.\nAnd for the statistics database \nmysql --user=root --port=3308 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/mysql.sock --password\n\nwith\ncreate database statistics;\n\nand then to establish the users, we execute\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@localhost identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@stroomp00.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@stroomp01.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\n\nthen\nquit;\n\nto exit.\nClearly if we need to add more processing nodes, additional grant commands would be used. Further, if we were installing the databases in a single node Stroom environment, we would just have the first two pairs of grants.\nConfigure Firewall\nNext we need to modify our firewall to allow remote access to our databases which listens on ports 3307 and 3308.\nThe simplest way to achieve this is with the commands\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3307/tcp --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3308/tcp --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nNote that this allows ANY node to connect to your databases. You should give consideration to restricting this to only allowing processing node access.\nDebugging of Mariadb for Stroom\nIf there is a need to debug the Mariadb database and Stroom interaction, one can turn on auditing for the Mariadb service.\nTo do so, log onto the relevant database as the administrative user as per\nmysql --user=root --port=3307 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0/mysql.sock --password\nor\nmysql --user=root --port=3308 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/mysql.sock --password\n\nand at the MariaDB [(none)]> prompt enter\ninstall plugin server_audit SONAME 'server_audit';\nset global server_audit_file_path='/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld0_server_audit.log';\nor\nset global server_audit_file_path='/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld1_server_audit.log';\nset global server_audit_logging=ON;\nset global server_audit_file_rotate_size=10485760;\ninstall plugin SQL_ERROR_LOG soname 'sql_errlog';\nquit;\n\nThe above will generate two log files, \n\n/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld0_server_audit.log or /var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld1_server_audit.log which records all commands the respective databases run. We have configured the log file will rotate at 10MB in size.\n/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0/sql_errors.log or /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/sql_errors.log which records all erroneous SQL commands. This log file will rotate at 10MB in size. Note we cannot set this filename via the UI, but it will be appear in the data directory.\nAll files will, by default, generate up to 9 rotated files.\n\nIf you wish to rotate a log file manually, log into the database as the administrative user and execute either\n\nset global server_audit_file_rotate_now=1; to rotate the audit log file\nset global sql_error_log_rotate=1; to rotate the sql_errlog log file\n\nInitial Database Access\nIt should be noted that if you monitor the sql_errors.log log file on a new Stooom deployment, when the Stoom Application first starts, it's initial access to the stroom database will result in the following attempted sql statements.\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.schema_version' doesn't exist : SELECT version FROM schema_version ORDER BY installed_rank DESC\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.STROOM_VER' doesn't exist : SELECT VER_MAJ, VER_MIN, VER_PAT FROM STROOM_VER ORDER BY VER_MAJ DESC, VER_MIN DESC, VER_PAT DESC LIMIT 1\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.FD' doesn't exist : SELECT ID FROM FD LIMIT 1\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.FEED' doesn't exist : SELECT ID FROM FEED LIMIT 1\n\nAfter this access the application will realise the database does not exist and it will initialise the database.\nIn the case of the statistics database you may note the following attempted access\n2017-04-16 16:25:09 stroomstats[stroomstats] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'statistics.schema_version' doesn't exist : SELECT version FROM schema_version ORDER BY installed_rank DESC\n\nAgain, at this point the application will initialise this database.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHowTo.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Installation\nThis HOWTO is provided to assist users in setting up a number of different Stroom environments based on Centos 7.3 infrastructure.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions are used in this document.\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills.\ninstallations are on Centos 7.3 minimal systems (fully patched).\nthe term 'node' is used to reference the 'host' a service is running on. \nthe Stroom Proxy and Application software runs as user 'stroomuser' and will be deployed in this user's home directory\ndata will reside in a directory tree referenced via '/stroomdata'. It is up to the user to provision a filesystem here, noting sub-directories of it will be NFS shared in Multi Node Stroom Deployments\nany scripts or commands that should run are in code blocks and are designed to allow the user to cut then paste the commands onto their systems\nin this document, when a textual screen capture is documented, data entry is identified by the data surrounded by '' . This excludes enter/return presses.\nbetter security of password choices, networking, firewalls, data stores, etc. can and should be achieved in various ways, but these HOWTOs are just a quick means of getting a working system, so only limited security is applied\nbetter configuration of the database (e.g. more memory. redundancy) should be considered in production environments\nthe use of self signed certificates is appropriate for test systems, but users should consider appropriate CA infrastructure in production environments\nthe user has access to a Chrome web browser as Stroom is optimised for this browser.\n\nIntroduction\nThis HOWTO provides guidance on a variety of simple Stroom deployments.\n\nMulti Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application)\nfor an environment where multiple nodes are required to handle the processing load.\n\nForwarding Stroom Proxy\nfor extensive networks where one wants to aggregate data through a proxy before sending data to the central Stroom processing systems.\n\nStandalone Stroom Proxy\nfor disconnected networks where collected data can be manually transferred to a Stroom processing service.\n\nAddition of a Node to Stroom Cluster\nfor when one needs to add an additional node to an existing cluster.\n\n\nNodename Nomenclature\nFor simplicity sake, the nodenames used in this HOWTO are geared towards the Multi Node Stroom Cluster deployment. That is,\n\nthe database nodename is stroomdb0.strmdev00.org\nthe processing nodenames are stroomp00.strmdev00.org, stroomp01.strmdev00.org, and stroomp02.strmdev00.org\nthe first node in our cluster, stroomp00.strmdev00.org, also has the CNAME stroomp.strmdev00.org\n\nIn the case of the Proxy only deployments,\n\nthe forwarding Stroom proxy nodename is stoomfp0.strmdev00.org\nthe standalone nodename will be stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nStorage\nBoth the Stroom Proxy and Application store data. The typical requirement is\n\ndirectory for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\ndirectory for Stroom application permanent data files (events, etc.)\ndirectory for Stroom application index data files\ndirectory for Stroom application working files (temporary files, output, etc.)\n\nWhere multiple processing nodes are involved, the application's permanent data directories need to be accessible by all participating nodes. \nThus a hierarchy for a Stroom Proxy might by\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-proxy\n\nand for an Application node\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data\n/stroomdata/stroom-index\n/stroomdata/stroom-working\n\nIn the following examples, the storage hierarchy proposed will more suited for a multi node Stroom cluster, including the Forwarding or\nStandalone proxy deployments. This is to simplify the documentation. Thus, the above structure is generalised into\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-pnn/proxy\n\nand\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-pnn\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-pnn\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-pnn\n\nwhere nn is a two digit node number. The reason for placing the proxy directory within the Application working area\nwill be explained later.\nAll data should be owned by the Stroom processing user. In this HOWTO, we will use stroomuser\nMulti Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application) Deployment\nIn this deployment we will install the database on a given node then deploy both the Stroom Proxy and Stroom Application software\nto both our processing nodes. At this point we will then integrate a web service to run 'in-front' of our Stroom software and\nthen perform the initial configuration of Stroom via the user interface.\nDatabase Installation\nThe Stroom capability requires access to two MySQL/MariaDB databases. The first is for persisting application configuration and metadata information, and the second is for the Stroom Statistics capability.\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom databases can be found here.\nAlthough these instructions describe the deployment of the databases to their own node, there is no reason why one can't\njust install them both on the first (or only) Stroom node.\nPrerequisite Software Installation\nCertain software packages are required for either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\nmariadb or mysql client\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\n\nOne has a choice of database clients. MariaDB is directly supported by Centos 7 and is simplest to install. This is done via\nsudo yum -y install mariadb\n\nOne could deploy the MySQL database software as the alternative.\nTo do this you need to install the MySQL Community repository files then install the client. \nInstructions for installation of the MySQL Community repository files can be\nfound here or on\nthe MySQL Site.\nOnce you have installed the MySQL repository files, install the client via\nsudo yum -y install mysql-community-client\n\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the Web Service Integration section of this document.\nNote also, that Standalone or Forwarding Stroom Proxy deployments do NOT need a database client deployed.\nEntropy Issues in Virtual environments\nBoth the Stroom Application and Stroom Proxy currently run on Tomcat (Version 7) which relies on the Java SecureRandom class to provide\nrandom values for any generated session identifiers as well as other components. In some circumstances the Java runtime can be delayed if the entropy source that is\nused to initialise SecureRandom is short of entropy. The delay is caused by the Java runtime waiting on the blocking entropy souce\n/dev/random to have sufficient entropy. This quite often occurs in virtual environments were there are few sources that can contribute to \na system's entropy.\nTo view the current available entropy on a Linux system, run the command\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n\nA reasonable value would be over 2000 and a poor value would be below a few hundred.\nIf you are deploying Stroom onto systems with low available entropy, the start time for the Stroom Proxy can be as high as 5 minutes and for\nthe Application as high as 15 minutes.\nOne software based solution would be to install the haveged service that attempts to provide an easy-to-use, unpredictable random number generator based upon an adaptation of the HAVEGE algorithm.\nTo install execute\nyum -y install haveged\nsystemctl enable haveged\nsystemctl start haveged\n\nFor background reading in this matter, see this reference or this reference.\nStorage Scenario\nFor the purpose of this Installation HOWTO, the following sets up the storage hierarchy for a two node processing\ncluster. To share our permanent data we will use NFS. Accept that the NFS deployment described here is very simple, and\nin a production deployment, a lot more security controls should be used. Further, \nOur hierarchy is\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00    - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00    - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00    - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01    - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01    - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01    - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nCreation of Storage Hierarchy\nSo, we first create processing user on all nodes as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nAnd the relevant commands to create the above hierarchy would be\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01  # So that this node can mount stroomp01's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00  # So that this node can mount stroomp00's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nDeployment of NFS to share Stroom Storage\nWe will use NFS to cross mount the permanent data directories. That is\n\nnode stroomp00.strmdev00.org will mount stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 and,\nnode stroomp01.strmdev00.org will mount stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00.\n\nThe HOWTO guide to deploy and configure NFS for our Scenario is here\nStroom Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere.\nStroom Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here.\nStroom Application Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom application can be found here.\nWeb Service Integration\nOne typically 'fronts' either a Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service. The following\nprovides instructions for this. The created certificates can then be used when configuration the web service.\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nInstallation Validation\nWe will now check that the installation and web services integration has worked.\nSanity firewall check\nTo ensure you have the firewall correctly set up, the following command\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nshould result in\npublic (active)\n  target: default\n  icmp-block-inversion: no\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client http https nfs ssh\n  ports: 8009/tcp 9080/tcp 8080/tcp 9009/tcp\n  protocols: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  sourceports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules:\nTest Posting of data to the Stroom service\nYou can test the data posting service with the command\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nwhich *WILL) result in an error as we have not configured the Stroom Application as yet.

In this deployment, you should enter the URLS\nhttp://stroomp.strmdev00.org, or https://stroomp.strmdev00.org or https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom, noting the first URLs\nshould automatically direct you to the last URL.\nIf you have personal certificates loaded in your Chrome browser, you may be asked which certificate to use to authenticate yourself\nto stroomp.strmdev00.org:443. As Stroom has not been configured to use user certificates, the choice is not relevant, just choose one\nand continue.\nAdditionally, if you are using  self-signed certificates, your browser will generate an alert as per\n\nTo proceed you need to select the ADVANCED hyperlink to see\n\nIf you select the Proceed to stroomp.strmdev00.org (unsafe) hyper-link you will be presented with the standard Stroom UI login page.\n\nThis page has two panels - About Stroom and Login.\nIn the About Stroom panel we see an introductory description of Stroom in the top left and deployment details in the bottom left of the panel. The deployment details provide\n\nBuild Version: - the build version of the Stroom application deployed\nBuild Date: - the date the version was built\nUp Date: - the install date\nNode Name: - the node within the Stroom cluster you have connected to\n\nLogin with Stroom default Administrative User\nEach new Stroom deployment automatically creates the administrative user admin and this user's password is initially set to admin.\nWe will\nlogin as this user\nwhich also validates that the database and UI is working correctly in that you can login and the password is admin.\nCreate an Attributed User to perform configuration\nWe should configure Stroom using an attributed user account.\nThat is, we should\ncreate\na user, in our case it will be burn (the author) and once created, we login with that account then perform the initial configuration activities.\nYou don't have to do this, but it is sound security practice.\nOnce you have created the user you should\nlog out\nof the admin account and log back in as our user burn.\nConfigure the Volumes for our Stroom deployment\nBefore we can store data within Stroom we need to configure the\nvolumes\nwe have allocated in our Storage hierarchy. The\nVolume Maintenance HOWTO\nshows how to do this.\nConfigure the Nodes for our Stroom deployment\nIn a Stroom cluster, nodes are expected to communicate with each other on port 8080 over http. Our\ninstallation in a multi node environment ensures the firewall will allow this but we also need to\nconfigure the nodes. This is achieved via the Stroom UI where we set a Cluster URL for each node.\nThe following Node Configuration HOWTO demonstrates how do\nset the Cluster URL.\nData Stream Processing\nTo enable Stroom to process data, it's\nStream Processors\nneed to be enabled. There are NOT enabled by default on installation. The following\nsection\nin our Stroom Tasks HowTo shows how to do this.\nTesting our Stroom Application and Proxy Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that we can send and ingest data.\nAdd a Test Feed\nIn order for Stroom to be able to handle various data sources, be they Apache HTTPD web access logs,\nMicroSoft Windows Event logs or Squid Proxy logs, Stroom must be told what the data is when it is received.\nThis is achieved using\nEvent Feeds.\nEach feed has a unique name within the system.\nTo test our installation can accept and ingest data, we will\ncreate a test Event feed. The 'name' of the feed will be\nTEST-FEED-V1_0. Note that in a production environment is is best that a well defined nomenclature is used for feed 'names'. For our\ntesting purposes TEST-FEED-V1_0 is sufficient.\nSending Test Data\nNOTE: Before testing our new feed, we should restart both our Stroom application services so that any volume changes are\npropagated. This can be achieved by simply running\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\nbin/StopServices.sh\nbin/StartServices.sh\n\non both nodes. It is suggested you first log out of Stroom, if you are currently logged in and you should monitor the Stroom\napplication logs to ensure it has successfully restarted. Remember to use the T and Tp bash aliases we set up.\nFor this test, we will send the contents of /etc/group to our test feed. We will also send the file from the cluster's database\nmachine. The command to send this file is\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nWe will test a number of features as part of our installation test. These are\n\nsimple post of data\nsimple post of data to validate load balancing is working\nsimple post to direct feed interface\nsimple post to direct feed interface to validate load balancing is working\nidentify that the Stroom Proxy Aggregation is working correctly\n\nAs part of our testing will check the presence of the inbound data, as files, within the proxy storage area.\nNow as the proxy storage area is also the location from which the Stroom application\nautomatically aggregates then ingests the data stored by the proxy, we can either turn off the\nProxy Aggregation task,\nor attempt to\nperform our tests noting that proxy aggregation occurs every 10 minutes by default. For simplicity, we will\nturn off the Proxy Aggregation task.\nWe can now perform out tests. Follow the steps in the Data Posting Tests section\nof the Testing Stroom Installation HOWTO\nForwarding Stroom Proxy Deployment\nIn this deployment will install a Stroom Forwarding Proxy which is designed to aggregate data posted to it for managed forwarding to \na central Stroom processing system.

This is\ndescribed in the\nWeb Service Integration for Forwarding Proxy\nsection of this document.\nForwarding Proxy Storage\nSince we are a proxy that stores data sent to it and forwards it each minute we have only one directory.\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files prior to forwarding\n\nYou will note that these HOWTOs use a consistent storage nomenclature for simplicity of documentations.\nCreation of Storage for Forwarding Proxy\nWe create the processing user, as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage hierarchy with the commands\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nStroom Forwarding Proxy Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing the Stroom Forwarding Proxy, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Although this setup HOWTO is orientated towards a complete Stroom Proxy\nand Application installation, it does provide all the processing user setup requirements for a Stroom Proxy as well.\nStroom Forwarding Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here, noting you\nshould follow the steps for configuring the proxy as a Forwarding proxy.\nWeb Service Integration for Forwarding Proxy\nOne typically 'fronts' a Stroom Proxy with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service. The\nSSL Certificate Generation HOWTO provides instructions for this. \nThe created certificates can then be used when configuration the web service. NOTE also, that for a forwarding\nproxy we will need to establish Key and Trust stores as well. This is also documented in the SSL Certificate Generation HOWTO\nhere\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here. Please take note of where a Stroom Proxy\nconfiguration item is different to that of a Stroom Application processing node.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nTesting our Forwarding Proxy Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that we can send data to the forwarding proxy and that it forwards the files\nit receives to the central Stroom processing system. As stated earlier, it is assumed we have installed, configured and tested the destination\ncentral Stroom processing system and thus we will have a test Feed\nalready established - TEST-FEED-V1_0.\nSending Test Data\nFor this test, we will send the contents of /etc/group to our test feed - TEST-FEED-V1_0.

This scenario is assuming we are installing on the fully patch Centos 7.3 host, stroomsap0.strmdev00.org.\nWe will first deploy the Stroom Proxy then configure it as a Standalone Proxy then integrate a web service to run 'in-front' of\nProxy.\nPrerequisite Software Installation for Forwarding Proxy\nCertain software packages are required for the Stroom Proxy to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\n\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the\nWeb Service Integration for Standalone Proxy\nsection of this document.\nStandalone Proxy Storage\nSince we are a proxy that stores data sent to it we have only one directory.\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\nYou will note that these HOWTOs use a consistent storage nomenclature for simplicity of documentations.\nCreation of Storage for Standalone Proxy\nWe create the processing user, as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage hierarchy with the commands\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nStroom Standalone Proxy Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing the Stroom Standalone Proxy, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Although this setup HOWTO is orientated towards a complete Stroom Proxy\nand Application installation, it does provide all the processing user setup requirements for a Stroom Proxy as well.\nStroom Standalone Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here, noting you\nshould follow the steps for configuring the proxy as a  Store_NoDB proxy.\nWeb Service Integration for Standalone Proxy\nOne typically 'fronts' a Stroom Proxy with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service.

Once we have deploy and configured the Stroom software, we will then integrate a web\nservice to run 'in-front' of our Stroom software, and then perform the initial configuration of to add this node via the user interface. The\nnode we will add is stroomp02.strmdev00.org.\nGrant access to the database for this node\nConnect to the Stroom database as the administrative (root) user, via the command\nsudo mysql --user=root -p\n\nand at the MariaDB [(none)]> or mysql> prompt enter\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp02.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\nquit;\n\nPrerequisite Software Installation\nCertain software packages are required for either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\nmariadb or mysql client\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\nsudo yum -y install mariadb\n\nIn the above instance, the database client choice is MariaDB as it is directly supported by Centos 7. One could deploy the MySQL\ndatabase software as the alternative. If you have chosen a different database for the already deployed Stroom Cluster then you\nshould use that one. See earlier in this document on how to install the MySQL Community client.\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the Web Service Integration section of this document.\nStorage Scenario\nTo maintain our Storage Scenario them, the scenario for this node is\n\nNode: stroomp02.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. tmp, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nCreation of Storage Hierarchy\nSo, we first create processing user on our new node as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage via\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00  # So that this node can mount stroomp00's data directory\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01  # So that this node can mount stroomp01's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nAs we need to share this new nodes permanent data directories to the existing nodes in the Cluster, we need to\ncreate mount point directories on our existing nodes in addition to deploying NFS.\nSo we execute on\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chmod 750 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chown stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nand on \n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.orgsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chmod 750 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chown stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nDeployment of NFS to share Stroom Storage\n\n\nWe will use NFS to cross mount the permanent data directories. That is\n\nnode stroomp00.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 and,\nstroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 and,\n\n\nnode stroomp01.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 and\nstroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\n\nnode stroomp02.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 and\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\n\n\nThe HOWTO guide to deploy and configure NFS for our Scenario is here.\nStroom Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Note you should remember to set the N bash variable \nwhen generating the Environment Variable files to 02.\nStroom Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here. Note you\nwill be deploying a Store proxy and during the setup execution ensure you enter the appropriate values for NODE ('stroomp02')\nand REPO_DIR ('/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy'). All other values will be the same.\nStroom Application Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom application can be found here.\nWhen executing the setup script ensure you enter the appropriate values for TEMP_DIR ('/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02') and NODE ('stroomp02').\nAll other values will be the same. Note also that you will not have to wait for the 'first' node to initialise the Stroom database as\nthis would have already been done when you first deployed your Stroom Cluster.\nWeb Service Integration\nOne typically 'fronts' either a Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nAs we are a cluster, we use the same certificate as the other nodes. Thus we need to gain the certificate package from an existing node.\nSo, on stroomp00.strmdev00.org, we replicate the directory ~stroomuser/stroom-jks to our new node. That is, tar it up, copy the tar file to\nstroomp02 and untar it. We can make use of the other node's mounted file system.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar cf stroom-jks.tar stroom-jks\nmv stroom-jks.tar /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nthen on our new node (stroomp02.strmdev00.org) we extract the data.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar xf /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02/stroom-jks.tar && rm -f /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02/stroom-jks.tar\n\nNow ensure protection, ownership and SELinux context for these files by running\nchmod 700 ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/private ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchown -R stroomuser:stroomuser ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchcon -R --reference /etc/pki ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\n\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here.\nYou should pay particular attention to the section on the\nApache Mod_JK configuration\nas you MUST regenerate the Mod_JK workers.properties file on the existing cluster nodes as well as generating it on our new node.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nNote that once you have integrated the web services for our new node, you will need to restart the Apache systemd process on the existing\ntwo nodes that that the new Mod_JK configuration has taken place.\nInstallation Validation\nWe will now check that the installation and web services integration has worked. We do this with a simple firewall check\nand later perform complete integration tests.\nSanity firewall check\nTo ensure you have the firewall correctly set up, the following command\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nshould result in\npublic (active)\n  target: default\n  icmp-block-inversion: no\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client http https nfs ssh\n  ports: 8009/tcp 9080/tcp 8080/tcp 9009/tcp\n  protocols: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  sourceports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules:\nStroom Application Configuration - New Node\nWe will need to configure this new node's Volumes, set it's Cluster URL and enable it's Stream Processors.\nWe do this by logging into the Stroom User Interface (UI) with an account with Administrator privileges. It\nis recommended you use a attributed user for this activity. Once you have logged in you can configure this\nnew node.\nConfigure the Volumes for our Stroom deployment\nBefore we can store data on this new Stroom node we need to configure it's\nvolumes\nwe have allocated in our Storage hierarchy. The section on adding new volumes in the\nVolume Maintenance HOWTO\nshows how to do this.\nConfigure the Nodes for our Stroom deployment\nIn a Stroom cluster, nodes are expected to communicate with each other on port 8080 over http. Our\ninstallation in a multi node environment ensures the firewall will allow this but we also need to\nconfigure the new node. This is achieved via the Stroom UI where we set a Cluster URL for our node.\nThe section on Configuring a new node in the \nNode Configuration HOWTO demonstrates how do\nset the Cluster URL.\nData Stream Processing\nTo enable Stroom to process data, it's\nStream Processors\nneed to be enabled. There are NOT enabled by default on installation. The following\nsection\nin our Stroom Tasks HowTo shows how to do this.\nTesting our New Node Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that our new node has successfully integrated into our cluster.\nFirst we need to ensure we have restarted the Apache Httpd service (httpd.service) on the original nodes so that the new workers.properties\nconfiguration files take effect.\nWe now test the node integration by running the tests we use to validate a Multi Node Stroom Cluster Deployment found\nhere noting we should\nmonitor all three nodes proxy and application log files. Basically we are looking to see that this new node participates in the\nload balancing for the stroomp.strmdev00.org cluster.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallProcessingUserSetupHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallProcessingUserSetupHowTo.html","title":"Processing User Setup","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Processing User Setup\nThis HOWTO demonstrates how to set up various files and scripts that the Stroom processing user requires.\nAssumptions\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills\ninstallation is on a fully patched minimal Centos 7.3 instance.\nthe application user stroomuser has been created\nthe user is deploying for either\nthe example two node Stroom cluster whose storage is described here\na simple Forwarding or Standalone Proxy\nadding a node to an existing Stroom cluster\n\n\n\nSet up the Stroom processing user's environment\nTo automate the running of a Stroom Proxy or Application service under out Stroom processing user, stroomuser, there are a number of configuration files and scripts we need to deploy.\nWe first become the stroomuser\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\n\nEnvironment Variable files\nWhen either a Stroom Proxy or Application starts, it needs predefined environment variables. We set these up in the stroomuser home directory.\nWe need two files for this. The first is for the Stroom processes themselves and the second is for the Stroom systemd service we deploy. The\ndifference is that for the Stroom processes, we need to export the environment variables where as the Stroom systemd service file just needs to read them.\nThe JAVA_HOME and PATH variables are to support Java running the Tomcat instances.\nThe STROOM_TMP variable is set to a working area for the Stroom Application to use. The application accesses this environment variable internally\nvia the ${stroom_tmp} context variable. Note that we only need the STROOM_TMP variable for Stroom Application deployments, so one\ncould remove it from the files for a Forwarding or Standalone proxy deployment.\nWith respect to the working area, we will make use of the Storage Scenario we have defined and hence use the directory /stroomdata/stroom-working-p_nn_ where nn is the hostname node number (i.e 00 for host stroomp00, 01 for host stroomp01, etc).\nSo, for the first node, 00, we run\nN=00\nF=~/env.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export STROOM_TMP=/stroomdata/stroom-working-p%s\\n' ${N} >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nF=~/env_service.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services, executed out of systemd service\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'STROOM_TMP=/stroomdata/stroom-working-p%s\\n' ${N} >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nthen we can change the N variable on each successive node and run the above.\nAlternately, for a Stroom Forwarding or Standalone proxy, the following would be sufficient\nF=~/env.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nF=~/env_service.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services, executed out of systemd service\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nAnd we integrate the environment into our bash instantiation script as well as setting up useful bash functions.

This could include improved firewall configuration to limit NFS access, NFS4 with Kerberos etc.\n\nInstallation of NFS software\nWe install NFS on each node, via\nsudo yum -y install nfs-utils\n\nand enable the relevant services, via\nsudo systemctl enable rpcbind\nsudo systemctl enable nfs-server\nsudo systemctl enable nfs-lock\nsudo systemctl enable nfs-idmap\nsudo systemctl start rpcbind\nsudo systemctl start nfs-server\nsudo systemctl start nfs-lock\nsudo systemctl start nfs-idmap\n\nConfiguration of NFS exports\nWe now export the node's /stroomdata directory (in case you want to share the working directories) by configuring /etc/exports. For simplicity sake, we will allow all nodes with the hostname nomenclature of stroomp*.strmdev00.org to mount the /stroomdata directory. This means the same configuration applies to all nodes.\n# Share Stroom data directory\n/stroomdata    stroomp*.strmdev00.org(rw,sync,no_root_squash)\nThis can be achieved with the following on both nodes\nsudo su -c \"printf '# Share Stroom data directory\\n' >> /etc/exports\"\nsudo su -c \"printf '/stroomdata\\tstroomp*.strmdev00.org(rw,sync,no_root_squash)\\n' >> /etc/exports\"\n\nOn both nodes restart the NFS service to ensure the above export takes effect via\nsudo systemctl restart nfs-server\n\nSo that our nodes can offer their filesystems, we need to enable NFS access on the firewall.\nThis is done via\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=nfs --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nTest Mounting\nYou should do test mounts on each node.\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mount -t nfs4 stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mount -t nfs4 stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00\n\nIf you are concerned you can't see the mount with a df try a df --type=nfs4 -a or a sudo df.

It will validate the batch with the database then store the batches as files in a configured directory.\n\nStore_NoDB\nA store_nodb proxy accepts batches of events, as files. It has no connectivity to the database, so it assumes all batches are valid, so it stores the batches as files in a configured directory.\n\nForwarding\nA forwarding proxy accepts batches of events, as files. It has indirect connectivity to the database via the destination proxy, so it validates the batches then stores the batches as files in a configured directory until they are periodically forwarded to the configured destination Stroom proxy.\n\n\nWe will demonstrate the installation of each.\nStore Proxy Configuration\nIn our Store Proxy description below, we will use the multi node deployment scenario. That is we are deploying the Store proxy on multiple Stroom nodes (stroomp00, stroomp01) and we have configured our storage as per the Storage Scenario which means the directories to install the inbound batches of data are /stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy and /stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy depending on the node.\nTo install a Store proxy, we run\nstroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh store\n\nduring which one is prompted for a number of configuration settings. Use the following\nNODE to be the hostname (not FQDN) of your host (i.e. 'stroomp00' or 'stroomp01' depending on the node we are installing on)\nPORT_PREFIX should use the default, just press return\nREPO_DIR should be set to '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy' or '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy' depending on the node we are installing on\nREPO_FORMAT can be left as the default, just press return\nJDBC_CLASSNAME should use the default, just press return\nJDBC_URL should be set to 'jdbc:mysql://stroomdb0.strmdev00.org:3307/stroom'\nDB_USERNAME should be our processing user, 'stroomuser'\nDB_PASSWORD should be the one we set when creating the stroom database, that is 'Stroompassword1@'\nJAVA_OPTS can use the defaults, but ensure you have sufficient memory, either change or accept the default\nAt this point, the script will configure the proxy. There should be no errors, but review the output.\nIf you make a mistake in the above, just re-run the script.\nNOTE: The selection of the REPO_DIR above and the setting of the STROOM_TMP environment variable earlier ensure that not only inbound files are placed in the REPO_DIR location but the Stroom Application itself will access the same directory when it aggregates inbound data for ingest in it's proxy aggregation threads.\nForwarding Proxy Configuration\nIn our Forwarding Proxy description below, we will deploy on a host named stroomfp0 and it will store the files in /stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy. Remember, we are being consistent with our Storage hierarchy to make documentation and scripting simpler. Our destination host to periodically forward the files to will be stroomp.strmdev00.org (the CNAME for stroomp00.strmdev00.org).\nTo install a Forwarding proxy, we run\nstroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh forward\n\nduring which one is prompted for a number of configuration settings. Use the following\nNODE to be the hostname (not FQDN) of your host (i.e. 'stroomfp0' in our example)\nPORT_PREFIX should use the default, just press return\nREPO_DIR should be set to '/stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy' which we created earlier.\nREPO_FORMAT can be left as the default, just press return\nFORWARD_SERVER should be set to our stroom server. (i.e. 'stroomp.strmdev00.org' in our example)\nJAVA_OPTS can use the defaults, but ensure you have sufficient memory, either change or accept the default\nAt this point, the script will configure the proxy. There should be no errors, but review the output.\nStore No Database Proxy Configuration\nIn our Store_NoDB Proxy description below, we will deploy on a host named stroomsap0 and it will store the files in /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy. Remember, we are being consistent with our Storage hierarchy to make documentation and scripting simpler.\nTo install a Store_NoDB proxy, we run\nstroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh store_nodb\n\nduring which one is prompted for a number of configuration settings.

There should be no errors, but review the output.\nApache/Mod_JK change\nFor all proxy deployments, if we are using Apache's mod_jk then we need to ensure the proxy's AJP connector specifies a 64K packetSize. View the file stroom-proxy/instance/conf/server.xml to ensure the Connector element for the AJP protocol has a packetSize attribute of 65536. For example,\ngrep AJP stroom-proxy/instance/conf/server.xml\n\nshows\n\nThis check is required for earlier releases of the Stroom Proxy. Releases since v5.1-beta.4 have set the AJP packetSize.\nStart the Proxy Service\nWe can now manually start our proxy service. Do so as the stroomuser with the command\nstroom-proxy/bin/start.sh\n\nNow monitor the directory stroom-proxy/instance/logs for any errors. Initially you will see the log files localhost_access_log.YYYY-MM-DD.txt and catalina.out. Check them for errors and correct (or pose a question to this arena).\nThe context path and unknown version warnings in catalina.out can be ignored.\nEventually (about 60 seconds) the log file stroom-proxy/instance/logs/stroom.log will appear. Again check it for errors.\nThe proxy will have completely started when you see the messages\nINFO  [localhost-startStop-1] spring.StroomBeanLifeCycleReloadableContextBeanProcessor (StroomBeanLifeCycleReloadableContextBeanProcessor.java:109) - ** proxyContext 0 START COMPLETE **\nand\nINFO  [localhost-startStop-1] spring.StroomBeanLifeCycleReloadableContextBeanProcessor (StroomBeanLifeCycleReloadableContextBeanProcessor.java:109) - ** webContext 0 START COMPLETE **\nIf you leave it for a while you will eventually see cyclic (10 minute cycle) messages of the form\nINFO  [Repository Reader Thread 1] repo.ProxyRepositoryReader (ProxyRepositoryReader.java:170) - run() - Cron Match at YYYY-MM-DD ...\nIf a proxy takes too long to start, you should read the section on Entropy Issues.\nProxy Repository Format\nA Stroom Proxy stores inbound files in a hierarchical file system whose root is supplied during the proxy setup (REPO_DIR) and as files arrive they are given a repository id that is a one-up number starting at one (1). The files are stored in a specific repository format.\nThe default template is ${pathId}/${id} and this pattern will produce the following output files under REPO_DIR for the given repository id\n\n\n\nRepository Id\nFilePath\n\n\n\n\n1\n000.zip\n\n\n100\n100.zip\n\n\n1000\n001/001000.zip\n\n\n10000\n010/010000.zip\n\n\n100000\n100/100000.zip\n\n\n\nSince version v5.1-beta.4, this template can be specified during proxy setup via the entry to the Stroom Proxy Repository Format prompt\n...\n@@REPO_FORMAT@@ : Stroom Proxy Repository Format [${pathId}/${id}] > \n...\nThe template uses replacement variables to form the file path. As indicated above, the default template is ${pathId}/${id} where ${pathId} is the automatically generated directory for a given repository id and ${id} is the repository id.\nOther replacement variables can be used to in the template including http header meta data parameters (e.g. '${feed}') and time based parameters (e.g. '${year}'). Replacement variables that cannot be resolved will be output as '_'. You must ensure that all templates include the '${id}' replacement variable at the start of the file name, failure to do this will result in an invalid repository.\nAvailable time based parameters are based on the file's time of processing and are zero filled (excluding ms).\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nyear\nfour digit year\n\n\nmonth\ntwo digit month\n\n\nday\ntwo digit day\n\n\nhour\ntwo digit hour\n\n\nminute\ntwo digit minute\n\n\nsecond\ntwo digit second\n\n\nmillis\nthree digit milliseconds value\n\n\nms\nmilliseconds since Epoch value\n\n\n\nProxy Repository Template Examples\nFor each of the following templates applied to a Store NoDB Proxy, the resultant proxy directory tree is shown after three posts were sent to the test feed TEST-FEED-V1_0 and two posts to the test feed FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0\nExample A - The default - ${pathId}/${id}\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$ find /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/001.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/002.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/003.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/004.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/005.zip\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$\n\nExample B - A feed orientated structure - ${feed}/${year}/${month}/${day}/${pathId}/${id}\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$ find /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017/07\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017/07/23\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017/07/23/001.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017/07/23/002.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/2017/07/23/003.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/2017\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/2017/07\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/2017/07/23\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/2017/07/23/004.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/2017/07/23/005.zip\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$\n\nExample C - A date orientated structure - ${year}/${month}/${day}/${pathId}/${id}\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$ find /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23/001.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23/002.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23/003.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23/004.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/2017/07/23/005.zip\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$\n\nExample D - A feed orientated structure, but with a bad parameter - ${feed}/${badparam}/${day}/${pathId}/${id}\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$ find /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/_\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/_/23\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/_/23/001.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/_/23/002.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/TEST-FEED-V1_0/_/23/003.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/_\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/_/23\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/_/23/004.zip\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy/FEED-NOVALUE-V9_0/_/23/005.zip\n[stroomuser@stroomsap0 ~]$\n\nand one would also see a warning for each post in the proxy's log file of the form\nWARN  [ajp-apr-9009-exec-4] repo.StroomFileNameUtil (StroomFileNameUtil.java:133) - Unused variables found: [badparam]\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallVolumesHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallVolumesHowTo.html","title":"Volumes","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Volume Maintenance\nStroom stores data in\nvolumes.\nThese are the logical link to the Storage hierarchy we setup on the operating system. This HOWTO will demonstrate how one first sets up volumes and also how\nto add additional volumes if one expanded an existing Stroom cluster.\nAssumptions\n\nan account with the Administrator Application Permission is currently logged in.\nwe will add volumes as per the Multi Node Stroom deployment Storage hierarchy\n\nConfigure the Volumes\nWe need to configure the volumes for Stroom. The follow demonstrates adding the volumes for two nodes, but demonstrates the process for a single node\ndeployment as well the volume maintenance needed when expanding a Multi Node Cluster when adding in a new node.\nTo configure the volumes, move to the Tools item of the Main Menu and select it to bring up the Tools sub-menu.\n\nthen move down and select the Volumes sub-item to be presented with the Volumes configuration window as seen below.\n\nThe attributes we see for each volume are\n\nNode - the processing node the volume resides on (this is just the node name entered when configuration the Stroom application)\nPath - the path to the volume\nVolume Type - The type of volume\nPublic - to indicate that all nodes would access this volume\nPrivate - to indicate that only the local node will access this volume\n\n\nStream Status\nActive - to store data within the volume\nInactive - to NOT store data within the volume\nClosed - had stored data within the volume, but now no more data can be stored\n\n\nIndex Status\nActive - to store index data within the volume\nInactive - to NOT store index data within the volume\nClosed - had stored index data within the volume, but now no more index data can be stored\n\n\nUsage Date - the date and time the volume was last used\nLimit - the maximum amount of data the system will store on the volume\nUsed - the amount of data in use on the volume\nFree - the amount of available storage on the volume\nUse% - the usage percentage\n\nIf you are setting up Stroom for the first time and you had accepted the default for the CREATE_DEFAULT_VOLUME_ON_START configuration option (true) when\nconfiguring the Stroom service application, you will see two default volumes have already been created. Had you set this option to false then the window would be empty.\nAdd Volumes\nNow from our two node Stroom Cluster example, our storage hierarchy was\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nFrom this we need to create four volumes. On stroomp00.strmdev00.org we create\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00       - location to store Stroom application index files\n\nand on stroomp01.strmdev00.org we create\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01       - location to store Stroom application index files \n\nSo the first step to configure a volume is to move the cursor to the New icon  in the top left of\nthe Volumes window and select it. This will bring up the Add Volume configuration window\n\nAs you can see, the entry box titles reflect the attributes of a volume. So we will add the first\nnodes data volume\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\nfor node stroomp00.\n\nIf you move the the Node drop down entry box and select it you will be presented with a choice of available\nnodes - in this case stroomp00 and stroomp01 as we have a two node cluster with these node names.\n\nBy selecting the node stroomp00 we see\n\nTo configure the rest of the attributes for this volume, we:\n\nenter the Path to our first node's data volume\nselect a Volume Type of Public as this is a data volume we want all nodes to access\nselect a Stream Status of Active to indicate we want to store data on it\nselect an Index Status of Inactive as we do NOT want index data stored on it\nset a Limit of 12GB for allowed storage\n\n\nand on selection of the \n\nwe see the changes in the Volumes configuration window\n\nWe next add the first node's index volume, as per\n\nAnd after adding the second node's volumes we are finally presented with our configured volumes\n\nDelete Default Volumes\nWe now need to deal with our default volumes. We want to delete them.\n\nSo we move the cursor to the first volume's line (stroomp00 /home/stroomuser/stroom-app/volumes/defaultindexVolume ...) and select the line then move the cursor to the  Delete icon  in the top left of the Volumes window and select it. On selection you will be given a confirmation request\n\nat which we press the \n\nbutton to see the first default volume has been deleted\n\nand after we select then delete the second default volume( stroomp00 /home/stroomuser/stroom-app/volumes/defaultStreamVolume ...), we are left with\n\nAt this one can close the Volumes configuration window by pressing the \n button.\nNOTE: At the time of writing there is an issue regarding volumes\nStroom Github Issue 84  - https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/84\nDue to Issue 84, if we delete volumes in a multi node environment, the deletion is not propagated to all other nodes in a cluster. Thus if we attempted to use the volumes we would get a database error.\nThe current workaround is to restart all the Stroom applications which will cause a reload of all volume information. This MUST be done before sending any data to your multi-node Stroom cluster.\nAdding new Volumes\nWhen one expands a Multi Node Stroom cluster deployment, after the installation of the Stroom Proxy and Application software and services on the new node,\none has to configure the new volumes that are on the new node. The following demonstrates this assuming we are adding\n\nthe new node is stroomp02\nthe storage hierarchy for this node is\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. tmp, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nFrom this we need to create two volumes on stroomp02\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n\nTo configure the volumes, move to the Tools item of the Main Menu and select it to bring up the Tools sub-menu.\n\nthen move down and select the Volumes sub-item to be presented with the Volumes configuration window as. We then move the cursor to\nthe New icon  in the top left of the Volumes window and select it. This will bring up the Add Volume configuration window where we select our volume's node stroomp02.\n\nWe select this node and then configure the rest of the attributes for this data volume\n\nthen press the\n button.\nWe then add another volume for the index volume for this node with attributes as per\n\nAnd on pressing the  button we see our two new volumes for this node have been added.\n\nAt this one can close the Volumes configuration window by pressing the \n button.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHttpdHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHttpdHowTo.html","title":"Httpd","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Apache Httpd/Mod_JK configuration for Stroom\nThe following is a HOWTO to assist users in configuring Apache's HTTPD with Mod_JK for Stroom.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions are used in this document.\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills\ninstallations are on Centos 7.3 minimal systems (fully patched)\nthe security of the HTTPD deployment should be reviewed for a production environment.\n\nInstallation of Apache httpd and Mod_JK Software\nTo deploy Stroom using Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) and Apache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications, we also need\n\napr\napr-util\napr-devel\ngcc\nhttpd\nhttpd-devel\nmod_ssl\nepel-release\ntomcat-native\napache's mod_jk tomcat connector plugin\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install apr apr-util apr-devel gcc httpd httpd-devel mod_ssl epel-release\nsudo yum -y install tomcat-native\n\nThe reason for the distinct tomcat-native installation is that this package is from the EPEL repository so it must be installed first.\nFor the Apache mod_jk Tomcat connector we need to acquire a recent\nrelease and install it.\nThe following commands achieve this for the 1.2.42 release.\nsudo bash\ncd /tmp\nV=1.2.42\nwget https://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/tomcat-connectors-${V}-src.tar.gz\ntar xf tomcat-connectors-${V}-src.tar.gz\ncd tomcat-connectors-*-src/native\n./configure --with-apxs=/bin/apxs\nmake && make install\ncd /tmp\nrm -rf tomcat-connectors-*-src\n\nAlthough you could remove the gcc compiler at this point, we leave it installed as one should continue to upgrade the Tomcat Connectors to later releases.\nConfigure Apache httpd\nWe need to configure Apache as the root user.\nIf the Apache httpd service is 'fronting' a Stroom user interface, we should create an index file (/var/www/html/index.html) on all nodes so browsing to\nthe root of the node will present the Stroom UI.

This excludes enter/return presses.\n\n\nCreate certificates\nThe first step is to establish a self signed certificate for our Stroom service. If you have a certificate server, then certainly gain an\nappropriately signed certificate. For this HOWTO, we will stay with a self signed solution and hence no certificate authorities are\ninvolved. If you are deploying a cluster, then you will only have one certificate for all nodes. We achieve this by setting up an\nalias for the first node in the cluster and then use that alias for addressing the cluster. That is, we have set up a\nCNAME, stroomp.strmdev00.org for stroomp00.strmdev00.org. This means within the web service we deploy, the ServerName will be stroomp.strmdev00.org\non each node. Since it's one certificate we only need to set it up on one node then deploy the certificate key files to other nodes.\nAs the certificates will be stored in the stroomuser's home directory, we become the stroom user\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\n\n\nTo make things simpler in the following bash extracts, we establish the bash variable H to be used in filename generation. The variable name\nis set to the name of the host (or cluster alias) your are deploying the certificates on. In our multi node HOWTO example we are using, we\nwould use the host CNAME stroomp.  Thus we execute\nexport H=stroomp\n\nNote in our the Stroom Forwarding Proxy HOWTO we would use the name stroomfp0. In the case of our Standalone Proxy we would use stroomsap0.\nWe set up a directory to house our certificates via\ncd ~stroomuser\nrm -rf stroom-jks\nmkdir -p stroom-jks stroom-jks/public stroom-jks/private\ncd stroom-jks\n\nCreate a server key for Stroom service (enter a password when prompted for both initial and verification prompts)\nopenssl genrsa -des3 -out private/$H.key 2048\n\nas per\nGenerating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus\n.................................................................+++\n...............................................+++\ne is 65537 (0x10001)\nEnter pass phrase for private/stroomp.key: \nVerifying - Enter pass phrase for private/stroomp.key: \nCreate a signing request.

That is,\ntar it up, copy the tar file to the other node(s) then untar it. We can make use of the other node's mounted file system for this process.\nThat is one could execute the commands on the first node, where we created the certificates\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar cf stroom-jks.tar stroom-jks\nmv stroom-jks.tar /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\nthen on the another node, say stroomp01.strmdev00.org, as the stroomuser we extract the data.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar xf /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01/stroom-jks.tar && rm -f /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01/stroom-jks.tar\n\nProtection, Ownership and SELinux Context\nNow ensure protection, ownership and SELinux context for these key files on ALL_ nodes via\nchmod 700 ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/private ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchown -R stroomuser:stroomuser ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchcon -R --reference /etc/pki ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\n\nStroom Proxy to Proxy Key and Trust Stores\nIn order for a Stroom Forwarding Proxy to communicate to a central Stroom proxy over https, the JVM running the forwarding proxy needs\nrelevant keystores set up.\nOne would set up a Stroom's forwarding proxy SSL certificate as per above, with the change that the\nhostname would be different. That is, in the initial setup, we would set the hostname variable H to be the hostname of the forwarding\nproxy. Lets say it is stroomfp0 thus we would set\nexport H=stroomfp0\n\nand then proceed as above.\nNote that you also need the public key of the central Stroom server you will be connecting to. For the following, we will assume\nthe central Stroom proxy is the stroomp.strmdev00.org server and it's public key is stored in the file stroomp.crt. We will store\nthis file on the forwarding proxy in ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/public/stroomp.crt.\nSo once you have created the forwarding proxy server's SSL keys and have deployed the central proxy's public key, we next\nneed to convert the proxy server's SSL keys into DER format. This is done by executing the following.\ncd ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nexport H=stroomfp0\nexport S=stroomp\nrm -f ${H}_k.jks ${S}_t.jks\nH_k=${H}\nS_k=${S}\n# Convert public key\nopenssl x509 -in public/$H.crt -inform PERM -out public/$H.crt.der -outform DER\n\nWhen you convert the local server's private key, you will be prompted for the server key password. \n# Convert the local server's Private key\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in private/$H.key.secure -inform PEM -out private/$H.key.der -outform DER\n\nas per\nEnter pass phrase for private/stroomfp0.key.secure: \nWe now import these keys into our Key Store. As part of the Stroom Proxy release, an Import Keystore application has been provisioned. We identify where it's found with the command\nfind ~stroomuser/*proxy -name 'stroom*util*.jar' -print | head -1\n\nwhich should return /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy/lib/stroom-proxy-util-v5.1-beta.10.jar or similar depending on the release version.\nTo make execution simpler, we set this as a shell variable as per\nStroom_UTIL_JAR=`find ~/*proxy -name 'stroom*util*.jar' -print | head -1`\n\nWe now create the keystore and import the proxy's server key\njava -cp ${Stroom_UTIL_JAR} stroom.util.cert.ImportKey keystore=${H}_k.jks keypass=$H alias=$H keyfile=private/$H.key.der certfile=public/$H.crt.der\n\nas per\nOne certificate, no chain\nWe now import the destination server's public key\nkeytool -import -noprompt -alias ${S} -file public/${S}.crt -keystore ${S}_k.jks -storepass ${S}\n\nas per\nCertificate was added to keystore\nWe now add the key and trust store location and password arguments to our Stroom proxy environment files.\nPWD=`pwd`\necho \"export JAVA_OPTS=\\\"-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${PWD}/${S}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=${S} -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${PWD}/${H}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=${H}\\\"\" >> ~/env.sh\necho \"JAVA_OPTS=\\\"-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${PWD}/${S}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=${S} -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${PWD}/${H}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=${H}\\\"\" >> ~/env_service.sh\n\nAt this point you should restart the proxy service. Using the commands\ncd ~stroomuser\nsource ./env.sh\nstroom-proxy/bin/stop.sh\nstroom-proxy/bin/start.sh\n\nthen check the logs to ensure it started correctly.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallApplicationHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallApplicationHowTo.html","title":"Application","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Installation of Stroom Application\nThis HOWTO describes the installation and initial configuration of the Stroom Application.\nAssumptions\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills\ninstallation is on a fully patched minimal Centos 7.3 instance.\nthe Stroom stroom database has been created and resides on the host stroomdb0.strmdev00.org listening on port 3307.\nthe Stroom stroom database user is stroomuser with a password of Stroompassword1@.\nthe Stroom statistics database has been created and resides on the host stroomdb0.strmdev00.org listening on port 3308.\nthe Stroom statistics database user is stroomuser with a password of Stroompassword2@.\nthe application user stroomuser has been created\nthe user is or has deployed the two node Stroom cluster described here\nthe user has set up the Stroom processing user as described here\nthe prerequisite software has been installed\nwhen a screen capture is documented, data entry is identified by the data surrounded by '' .

Use the following\nTEMP_DIR should be set to '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00' or '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01' etc depending on the node we are installing on\nNODE to be the hostname (not FQDN) of your host (i.e. 'stroomp00' or 'stroomp01' in our multi node scenario)\nRACK can be ignored, just press return\nPORT_PREFIX should use the default, just press return\nJDBC_CLASSNAME should use the default, just press return\nJDBC_URL to 'jdbc:mysql://stroomdb0.strmdev00.org:3307/stroom?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8'\nDB_USERNAME should be our processing user, 'stroomuser'\nDB_PASSWORD should be the one we set when creating the stroom database, that is 'Stroompassword1@'\nJPA_DIALECT should use the default, just press return\nJAVA_OPTS can use the defaults, but ensure you have sufficient memory, either change or accept the default\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC_CLASSNAME should use the default, just press return\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC_URL to 'jdbc:mysql://stroomdb0.strmdev00.org:3308/statistics?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8'\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB_USERNAME should be our processing user, 'stroomstats'\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB_PASSWORD should be the one we set when creating the stroom database, that is 'Stroompassword2@'\nSTATS_ENGINES should use the default, just press return\nCONTENT_PACK_IMPORT_ENABLED should use the default, just press return\nCREATE_DEFAULT_VOLUME_ON_START should use the default, just press return\nAt this point, the script will configure the application. There should be no errors, but review the output.\nIf you made an error then just re-run the script.\nYou will note that TEMP_DIR is the same directory we used for our STROOM_TMP environment variable when we set up the processing user scripts.\nNote that if you are deploying a single node environment, where the database is also running on your Stroom node, then the JDBC_URL setting can be the default.\nStart the Application service\nNow we start the application. In the case of multi node Stroom deployment, we start the Stroom application on the first node in the cluster,\nthen wait until it has initialised the database commenced it's Lifecycle task. You will need to monitor the log file to see it's\ncompleted initialisation.\nSo as the stroomuser start the application with the command\nstroom-app/bin/start.sh\n\nNow monitor stroom-app/instance/logs for any errors. Initially you will see the log files localhost_access_log.YYYY-MM-DD.txt\nand catalina.out. Check them for errors and correct (or post a question). The log4j warnings in catalina.out can be ignored.\nEventually the log file stroom-app/instance/logs/stroom.log will appear. Again check it for errors and then wait for the application to\nbe initialised. That is, wait for the Lifecycle service thread to start. This is indicated by the message\nINFO  [Thread-11] lifecycle.LifecycleServiceImpl (LifecycleServiceImpl.java:166) - Started Stroom Lifecycle service\nThe directory stroom-app/instance/logs/events will also appear with an empty file with\nthe nomenclature events_YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msecZ. This is the directory for storing Stroom's application event logs. We will return to this\ndirectory and it's content in a later HOWTO.\nIf you have a multi node configuration, then once the database has initialised, start the application service on all other nodes. Again with\nstroom-app/bin/start.sh\n\nand then monitor the files in its stroom-app/instance/logs for any errors. Note that in multi node configurations,\nyou will see server.UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler messages in the log file of the form\nWARN  [Stroom P2 #9 - GenericServerTask] server.UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler (UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler.java:150) - discover() - unable to contact stroomp00 - No cluster call URL has been set for node: stroomp00\nThis is ok as we will establish the cluster URL's later.\nMulti Node Firewall Provision\nIn the case of a multi node Stroom deployment, you will need to open certain ports to allow Tomcat to communicate to all nodes participating\nin the cluster.

See Folder Creation for details on creating such a folder.\nThere will be four components\n\nthe Event Feed to group the BlueCoat log files\nthe Text Converter to convert the BlueCoat raw logs files into simple XML\nthe XSLT Translation to translate the simple XML formed by the Text Converter into the Stroom Event Logging XML form, and\nthe Processing pipeline which manages how the processing is performed.\n\nAll components will have the same Name BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS.\nCreate the Event Feed\nWe first select (with a left click) the System/Event Sources/Proxy/BlueCoat folder in the Explorer tab then right click to bring up the New Item selection sub-menu.\n\nAs we are creating an Event Feed, select the  item to have the New Feed configuration window into which we enter BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS into the Name: entry box\n\nand press  to see the new Event Feed tab\n\nand it's corresponding reference in the Explorer display.\nThe configuration items for a Event Feed are\n\nDescription - a description of the feed\nClassification - the classification or sensitivity of the Event Feed data\nReference Feed Flag - to indicate if this is a Reference Feed or not\nFeed Status - which indicates if we accept data, reject it or silently drop it\nStream Type - to indicate if the Feed contains raw log data or reference data\nData Encoding - the character encoding of the data being sent to the Feed\nContext Encoding - the character encoding of context data associated with this Feed\nRetention Period - the amount of time to retain the Event data\n\nIn our example, we will set the above to\n\nDescription - BlueCoat Proxy log data sent in W2C Extended Log File Format (ELFF)\nClassification - We will leave this blank\nReference Feed Flag - We leave the check-box unchecked as this is not a Reference Feed\nFeed Status - We set to Receive\nStream Type - We set to Raw Events as we will be sending batches (streams) of raw event logs\nData Encoding - We leave at the default of UTF-8 as this is the proposed character encoding\nContext Encoding - We leave at the default of UTF-8 as there are no Context Events for this Feed\nRetention Period - We leave at Forever was we do not want to delete any collected BlueCoat event data.\n\n\nOne should note that the Feed tab as been marked as having unsaved changes. This is indicated by the asterisk\ncharacter * between the Feed icon  and the name of the feed BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS.\nWe can save the changes to our feed by pressing the Save icon  in\nthe top left of the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS tab. At this point one should notice two things, the first is that the asterisk\nhas disappeared from the Feed tab and the the second is that the Save icon  is now ghosted - .\n\nCreate the Text Converter\nWe now create the Text Converter for this Feed in a similar fashion to the Event Feed.\nWe first select (with a left click) the System/Event Sources/Proxy/BlueCoat folder in the Explorer tab then right click to bring up the New Item selection sub-menu.

As we are creating a Pipeline, select the  item to have the New Pipeline configuration window.\nEnter BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS into the Name: entry box and press the  which results in the creation of the Pipeline tab\n\nand it's corresponding reference in the Explorer display.\nWe set the configuration for this Pipeline to be\n\nDescription - Processing of XML of BlueCoat Proxy log data into Stroom Event Logging XML\nType - We leave as Event Data as this is an Event Data pipeline\n\nConfigure Pipeline Structure\nWe now need to configure the Structure of this Pipeline.\nWe do this by selecting the Structure hyper-link of the *BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Pipeline tab.\nAt this we see the Pipeline Structure configuration tab\n\nAs noted in the Assumptions at the start, we have loaded the Template Pipeline content pack, so that we can Inherit a pipeline structure from this content pack and configure it to support this specific feed.\nWe find a template by selecting the Inherit From: entry box labeled  to reveal a Choose Item configuration item window.\n\nSelect the Template Pipelines folder by pressing the  icon to the left of the folder to reveal the choice of available templates.\n\nFor our BlueCoat feed we will select the Event Data (Text) template. This is done by moving the cursor to the relevant line and select via a left click\n\nthen pressing  to see the inherited pipeline structure\n\nConfigure Pipeline Elements\nFor the purpose of this HOWTO, we are only interested in two of the eleven (11) elements in this pipeline\n\nthe Text Converter labeled dsParser\nthe XSLT Translation labeled translationFilter\n\nWe need to assign our BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Text Converter and XSLT Translation to these elements respectively.\nText Converter Configuration\nWe do this by first selecting (left click) the dsParser element at which we see the Property sub-window displayed\n\nWe then select (left click) the textConverter Property Name\n\nthen press the Edit Property button .  At this, the Edit Property configuration window is displayed.\n\nWe select the Value: entry box labeled  to reveal a Choose Item configuration item window.\n\nWe traverse the folder structure until we can select the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Text Converter as per\n\nand then press the  to see that the Property Value: has been selected.\n\nand pressing the  button of the Edit Property configuration window results in the pipelines dsParser property being set. \n\nXSLT Translation Configuration\nWe do this by first selecting (left click) the translationFilter element at which we see the Property sub-window displayed\n\nWe then select (left click) the xslt Property Name\n\nand following the same steps as for the Text Converter property selection, we assign the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS XSLT Translation to the xslt property.\n\nAt this point, we save these changes by pressing the Save icon .\nAuthoring the Translation\nWe are now ready to author the translation. Close all tabs except for the Welcome and BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed tabs.\nOn the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed tab, select the Data hyper-link to be presented with the Data pane of our tab.\n\nAlthough we can post our test data set to this feed, we will manually upload it via the Data pane. To do this we press the Upload button  in the top Data pane to display the Upload configuration window\n\nIn a Production situation, where we would post log files to Stroom, we would include certain HTTP Header variables that, as we shall see, will be used\nas part of the translation. These header variables typically provide situational awareness of the source system sending the events.\nFor our purposes we set\nEnvironment:Development\nLogFileName:sampleBluecoat.log\nMyHost:\"somenode.strmdev00.org\"\nMyIPaddress:\"192.168.2.220 192.168.122.1\"\nMyMeta:\"FQDN:somenode.strmdev00.org\\nipaddress:192.168.2.220\\nipaddress_eth0:192.168.2.220\\nipaddress_lo:127.0.0.1\\nipaddress_virbr0:192.168.122.1\\n\"\nMyNameServer:\"gateway.strmdev00.org.\"\nMyTZ:+1000\nShar256:056f0d196ffb4bc6c5f3898962f1708886bb48e2f20a81fb93f561f4d16cb2aa\nSystem:Site http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com/ Bluecoat Logs\nVersion:V1.0\nWe set these header variables in the Meta Data: entry box.\nWe select a Stream Type: of Raw Events\nWe leave the Effective: entry box empty as this stream of raw event logs does not have an Effective Date (only Reference Feeds set this).\nAnd we choose our file sampleBluecoat.logas per\n\nOn pressing  and Alert pop-up window is presented indicating the file was uploaded\n\nAgain press  to show that the data has been uploaded as a Stream into the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Event Feed.\n\nThe top pane holds a table of the latest streams that pertain to the feed. We see the one item which is the stream we uploaded. If we select it, we see that a stream summary is also displayed in the centre pane (which shows details of the specific selected feed and associated streams. We also see that the bottom pane displays the data associated with the selected item. In this case, the first lines of content from the BlueCoat sample log file.\n\nIf we were to select the Meta hyper-link of the lower pane, one would see the metadata Stroom records for this Stream of data.\n\nYou should see all the HTTP variables we set as part of the Upload step as well as some that Stroom has automatically set.\nWe new switch back to the Data hyper-link before we start to develop the actual translation.\nStepping the Pipeline\nWe will now author the two translation components of the pipeline, the data splitter that will transform our lines of BlueCoat data into a simple xml format and then the XSLT translation that will take this simple xml format and translate it into appropriate Stroom Event Logging XML form.\nWe start by ensuring our Raw Events Data stream is selected and we press the Enter Stepping Mode  button on the lower right hand side of the bottom Stream Data pane.\nYou will be prompted to select a pipeline to step with. Choose the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS pipeline\n\nthen press .\nStepping the Pipeline - Source\nYou will be presented with the Source element of the pipeline that shows our selected stream's raw data.\n\nWe see two panes here.\nThe top pane displays the Pipeline structure with Source selected (we could refer to this as the stepping pane) and it also displays a step indicator (three colon separated numbers enclosed in square brackets initially the numbers are dashes i.e. [-:-:-] as we have yet to step) and a set of green Stepping Actions. The step indicator and Stepping Actions allows one the step through a log file, selecting data event by event (an event is typically a line, but some events can be multi-line).\nThe bottom pane displays the first page (up to 100 lines) of data along with a set of blue Data Selection Actions. The Data Selection Actions are used to step through the source data 100 lines at a time. When multiple source log files have been aggregated into a single stream, two Data Selection Actions control buttons will be offered. The right hand one will allow a user to step though the source data as before, but the left hand set of control buttons allows one to step between files from the aggregated event log files.\nStepping the Pipeline - dsParser\nWe now select the dsParser pipeline element that results in \n\nThis window is made up of four panes.\nThe top pane remains the same - a display of the pipeline structure and the step indicator and green Stepping Actions.\nThe next pane down is the editing pane for the Text Converter. This pane is used to edit the text converter that converts our line based BlueCoat Proxy logs into a XML format. We make use of the Stroom Data Splitter facility to perform this transformation. See here for complete details on the data splitter.\nThe lower two panes are the input and output displays for the text converter.\nThe authoring of this data splitter translation is outside the scope of this HOWTO. It is recommended that one reads up on the Data Splitter and review the various samples found in the Stroom Context packs published, or the Pull Requests of https://github.com/gchq/stroom-content.\nFor the purpose of this HOWTO, the Datasplitter appears below. The author believes the comments should support the understanding of the transformation.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\nIt should be entered into the Text Converter's editing pane as per\n\nA copy of this DataSplitter can be found here.\nAs mentioned earlier, to step the translation, one uses the green  Stepping Actions.\nThe actions are\n\n - progress the transformation to the first line of the translation input\n - progress the transformation one step backward\n - progress the transformation one step forward\n - progress the transformation to the end of the translation input\n - refresh the transformation based on the current translation input\n\nSo, if one was to press the  stepping action we would be presented with\n\nWe see that the input pane has the first line of input from our sample file and the output pane has an XML record structure where we have defined a data element with the name attribute of bc_software and it's value attribute of SGOS 3.2.4.28. The definition of the record structure can be found in the System/XML Schemas/records folder.\nThis is the result of the code in our editor\n\n\n  \n\n\nIf one presses the  stepping action again, we see that we have moved to the second line of the input file with the resultant output of a data element with the name attribute of bc_version and it's value attribute of 1.0.\n\nStepping forward once more causes the translation to ignore the Date comment line, define a Data Splitter $headings variable from the Fields comment line and transform the first line of actual event data.\n\nWe see that a  element has been formed with multiple key value pair  elements where the name attribute is the key and the value attribute the value. You will note that the keys have been taken from the Fields comment line which where placed in the $headings variable.\nYou should also take note that the stepping indicator has been incrementing the last number, so at this point it is displaying\n[1:1:3]\nThe general form of this indicator is \n'[' streamId ':' subStreamId ':' recordNo ']'\nwhere\n\nstreamId - is the stream ID and won't change when stepping through the selected stream,\nsubStreamId - is the sub stream ID. When Stroom aggregates multiple event sources for a feed, it aggregates multiple input files and this is, in effect, the file number.\nrecordNo - is the record number within the sub stream.\n\nOne can double click on either the subStreamId or recordNo entry and enter a new value. This allows you to jump around a stream rather than just relying on first, previous, next and last movements.\nHovering the mouse over the stepping indicator will change the cursor to a hand pointer. Selecting (by a left click) the recordNo will allow you to edit it's value (and the other values for that matter). You will see the display change from\n\nto\n\nIf we change the record number from 3 to 12 then either press Enter or press the  action we see\n\nand note that a new record has been processed in the input and output panes. Further, if one steps back to the Source element of the pipeline to view the raw source file, we see that the highlighted current line is the 12th line of process data (It may be the 10 actual bluecoat event, but remember the #Software, #Version lines are considered as processed data)\n\nIf we select the dsParser pipeline element then press the  action we see the recordNo jump to 31 which is the last processed line of our sample log file.\n\nStepping the Pipeline - translationFilter\nWe now select the translationFilter pipeline element that results in \n\nAs for the dsParser, this window is made up of four panes.\nThe top pane remains the same - a display of the pipeline structure and the step indicator and green Stepping Actions.\nThe next pane down is the editing pane for the Translation Filter. This pane is used to edit an xslt translation that converts our simple key value pair  XML structure into another XML form.\nThe lower two panes are the input and output displays for the xslt translation. You will note that the input and output displays are identical for a null xslt translation is effectively a direct copy.\nIn this HOWTO we will transform the  XML structure into the GCHQ Stroom Event Logging XML Schema form which is documented here.\nThe authoring of this xslt translation is outside the scope of this HOWTO, as is the use of the Stroom XML Schema. It is recommended that one reads up on XSLT Conversion and the Stroom Event Logging XML Schema and review the various samples found in the Stroom Context packs published, or the Pull Requests of https://github.com/gchq/stroom-content.\nWe will build the translation in steps. We enter an initial portion of our xslt transformation that just consumes the Software and Version key values and converts the date and time values (which are in UTC) into the EventTime/TimeCreated element. This code segment is\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n\n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAfter entering this translation and pressing the  action shows the display\n\nNote that this is the 31st record, so if we were to jump to the first record using the  action, we see that the input and output change appropriately.\n\nYou will note that there is no Event element in the output as the record template only stores the input's key value and does not process an event log (the  in our xslt translation above).\nFurther note that the BlueCoat_Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS tab has a star in front of it and also the Save icon  is highlighted. This indicates that a component of the pipeline needs to be saved. In this case, the XSLT translation.\n\nBy pressing the Save icon, you will save the XSLT translation as it currently stands and both the star will be removed from the tab and the Save icon will no longer be highlighted.\n\nWe next extend out translation by authoring a event_source template to form an appropriate Stroom Event Logging EventSource element structure. Thus our translation now is\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n\n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nStepping to the 3 record (the first real data record in our sample log) will reveal that our output pane has gained an EventSource element.\n\nNote also, that our Save icon  is also highlighted, so we should at some point save the extensions to our translation.\nThe complete translation now follows.

the pipeline. Had our translation resulted in a malformed Event, this pipeline component displays any errors. In the screen below, we have purposely changed the EventTime/TimeCreated element to be EventTime/TimeCreatd. If one selects the schemaFilter component and then Refresh  the current step, we will see that\n\nthere is an error as indicated by a square Red box  in the top right hand corner\nthere is a Red rectangle line indicator mark  on the right hand side in the display slide bar\nthere is a Red error marker  on the left hand side\n\n\nHovering over the error marker  on the left hand side will bring a pop-up describing the error.\n\nAt this point, close the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS stepping tab, acknowledging you do not want to save your errant changes\n\nby pressing the  button.\nAutomated Processing\nNow that we have authored our translation, we want to enable Stroom to automatically process streams of raw event log data as it arrives. We do this by configuring a Processor in the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS pipeline.\nAdding a Pipeline Processor\nOpen the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS pipeline by selecting it (double left click) in the Explorer display to show\n\nTo configure a Processor we select the Processors hyper-link of the *BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Pipeline tab to reveal\n\nWe add a Processor by pressing the add processor button  in the top left hand corner. At this you will be presented with an Add Filter configuration window.\n\nAs we wish to create a Processor that will automatically process all BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS feed Raw Events we will select the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed and Raw Event Stream Type.\nTo select the feed, we press the Edit button .  At this, the Choose Feeds To Include And Exclude configuration window is displayed.\n\nAs we need to Include the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed in our selection, press the  button in the Include: pane of the window to be presented with a Choose Item configuration window.\n\nNavigate to the Event Sources/Proxy/BlueCoat folder and select the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed\n\nthen press the  button to select and see that the feed is included.\n\nAgain press the  button to close the Choose Feeds To Include And Exclude window to show that we have selected our feed in the Feeds: selection pane of the Add Filter configuration window.\n\nWe now need to select our Stream Type. Press the  button in the Stream Types: pane of the window to be presented with a Add Stream Type window with a Stream Type: selection drop down.\n\nWe select (left click) the drop down selection to display the types of Stream we can choose\n\nand as we are selecting Raw Events we select that item then press the  button at which we see that our Add Filter configuration window displays\n.\nAs we have selected our filter items, press the  button to display our configured Processors.\n.\nWe now see our display is divided into two panes. The Processors table pane at the top and the specific Processor pane below. In our case, our filter selection has left the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Filter selected in the Processors table\n.\nand the specific filter's details in the bottom pane.\n.\nThe column entries in the Processors Table pane describe\n\nPipeline - the name of the Processor pipeline () or Processor filter ()\nTracker Ms - the last time the tracker updated\nTracker % - the percentage of available streams completed\nLast Poll Age - the last time the processor found new streams to process\nTask Count - the number of processor tasks currently running\nPriority - the queue scheduling priority of task submission to available stream processors\nStreams - the number of streams that have been processed (includes currently running streams)\nEvents - ??\nStatus - the status of the processor. Normally empty if the number of stream is open-ended. If only are subset of streams were chosen (e.g. a time range in the filter) then the status will be Complete\nEnabled - check box to indicate the processor is enabled\n\nWe now need only Enable both the pipeline Processor and the pipeline Filter for automatic processing to occur. We do this by selecting both check boxes in the Enabled column.\n\nIf we refresh our Processor table by pressing the  button in the top right hand corner, we will see that more table entries have been filled in.\n\nWe see that the tracker last updated at 2018-07-14T04:00:35.289Z, the percentage complete is 100 (we only had one stream after all), the last time active streams were checked for was 2.3 minutes ago, there are no tasks running and that 1 stream has completed. Note that the Status column is blank as we have an open ended filter in that the processor will continue to select and process any new stream of Raw Events coming into the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS feed.\nIf we return to the BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS Feed tab, ensuring the Data* hyper-link is selected and then refresh () the top pane that holds the summary of the latest Feed streams\n\nWe see a new entry in the table. The columns display\n\nCreated - The time the stream was created.\nType - The type of stream. Our new entry has a type of 'Events' as we have processed our Raw Events data.\nFeed - The name of the stream's feed\nPipeline - The name of the pipeline involved in the generation of the stream\nRaw - The size in bytes of the raw stream data\nDisk - The size in bytes of the raw stream data when stored in compressed form on the disk\nRead - The number of records read by a pipeline\nWrite - The number of records (events) written by a pipeline. In this case the difference is that we did not generate events for the Software or Version records we read.\nFatal - The number of fatal errors the pipeline encountered when processing this stream\nError - The number of errors the pipeline encountered when processing this stream\nWarn - The number of warnings the pipeline encountered when processing this stream\nInfo - The number of informational alerts the pipeline encountered when processing this stream\nRetention - The retention period for this stream of data\n\nIf we also refresh () the specific feed pane (middle) we again see a new entry of the Events Type\n\nIf we select (left click) on the Events Type in either pane, we will see that the data pane displays the first event in the GCHQ Stroom Event Logging XML Schema form.\n\nWe can now send a file of BlueCoat Proxy logs to our Stroom instance from a Linux host using curl command and see how Stroom will automatically processes the file. Use the command\ncurl -k --data-binary @sampleBluecoat.log https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed -H\"Feed:BlueCoat-Proxy-V1.0-EVENTS\" -H\"Environment:Development\"  -H\"LogFileName:sampleBluecoat.log\" -H\"MyHost:\\\"somenode.strmdev00.org\\\"\" -H\"MyIPaddress:\\\"192.168.2.220 192.168.122.1\\\"\" -H\"System:Site http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com/ Bluecoat Logs\" -H\"Version:V1.0\"\n\nAfter Stroom's Proxy aggregation has occurred, we will see that the new file posted via curl has been loaded into Stroom as per\n\nand this new Raw Event stream is automatically processed a few seconds later as per\n\nWe note that since we have used the same sample file again, the Stream sizes and record counts are the same.\nIf we switch to the Processors tab of the pipeline we see that the Tracker timestamp has changed and the number of Streams processed has increased.\n\n"},"proxy/install.html":{"url":"proxy/install.html","title":"Installing Stroom proxy","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Proxy Install\nPrerequisites\n\nLinux Server's with at least 4GB RAM\nInstall files stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip, stroom-deploy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip\nTemporarily allow port 9080 if not relying on Apache Forwarding (see below)\n\nProcessing User Setup\nSee Processing User Setup.\nInstalling Stroom Proxy\nAs the processing user unpack the stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip installation files\nin the processing users home directory.\nunzip stroom-proxy-X-Y-Z-distribution.zip\n\nStroom Proxy can be setup as follows:\n\nforward - as an aggregation point to store and forwarding onto another Stroom or Stroom / Proxy\nstore - to front Stroom for data ingest\n\nStroom Proxy - forward\nIn forward mode you need to know the server address that data is being sent onto.\nRun the setup script to capture the basic settings required to run Stroom Proxy in forward mode.\n\n@@ NODE @@ - Each Stroom instance in the cluster needs a unique name, if this is a reinstall ensure you use the previous deployment.\nThis name needs match the name used in your worker.properties (e.g. 'node1' in the case 'node1.my.org') \n@@ PORT PREFIX @@ - By default Stroom Proxy will run on port 9080\n\n[stroomuser@node1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh forward\n\n[stroomuser@dev1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy/bin/setup.sh forward\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\nParameters\n==========\n\n@@NODE@@           : Unique node name for install [node1                                                     ] : node1\n@@PORT_PREFIX@@    : HTTP prefix to use           [90                                                        ] : 90\n@@REPO_DIR@@       : Stroom Proxy Repository Dir     [/stroomdata/stroom-proxy                                        ] : /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy-repo\n@@FORWARD_SERVER@@ : Server to forward data on to [hostname                                                  ] : audit.my.org\n@@JAVA_OPTS@@      : Optional tomcat JVM settings [\"-Xms512m -Xmx1g\"                                         ] :\n\n...\n\nStroom Proxy - store\nIn store mode you need to know the mysql details to validate incoming data with.\n[stroomuser@node1 ~]$ ./stroom-proxy-app/bin/setup.sh store\n\n...\n\n@@NODE@@           : Unique node name for install            [node                                                      ] :\n@@PORT_PREFIX@@    : HTTP prefix to use                      [90                                                        ] : 72\n@@REPO_DIR@@       : Stroom Proxy Repository Dir                [/stroomdata/stroom-proxy                                        ] : /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy-repo-2\n@@JDBC_CLASSNAME@@ : JDBC class name                         [com.mysql.jdbc.Driver                                     ] :\n@@JDBC_URL@@       : JDBC URL (jdbc:mysql://[HOST]/[DBNAME]) [jdbc:mysql://localhost/stroom                                ] :\n@@DB_USERNAME@@    : Database username                       [                                                          ] : stroomuser\n@@DB_PASSWORD@@    : Database password                       [                                                          ] :\n@@JAVA_OPTS@@      : Optional tomcat JVM settings            [\"-Xms512m -Xmx1g\"                                         ] :\n\nInstall Check\nStart the installed instance:\n./stroom-deploy/start.sh\n\nInspect the logs: \ntail -f stroom-proxy-app/instance/logs/stroom.log\n\nStroom Proxy Properties\nThe following properties can be configured in the stroom.properties file.\nTODO - Could do with a column indicating which proxy mode these properties apply to, e.g. store/forward\n\n\n\nProperty Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrepoDir\nOptional Repository DIR.

This is a guide for running Stroom in IntelliJ for the purposes of developing/debugging Stroom.\nPrerequisites\nIn order to build/run/debug Stroom you will need the following:\n\nJava 8 JDK\nGit\nGradle\nIntelliJ\nDocker CE\nDocker Compose\n\nThese instructions assume that all servcies will either run in the IDE or in Docker containers.\nEnvironment variables\nStroom git repositories\nTo develop stroom you will need to clone/fork multiple git repositories. To quickly clone all of the Stroom repositories you can use the helper script described in stroom-resource.\nDatabase setup\nStroom requires a MySQL database to run. You can either point stroom at a MySQL server or preferably at a MySQL Docker containers.\nMySQL in a Docker container\nSee the section below on stroom-resources.\nHost based MySQL server\nWith an instance of MySQL server 5.5 running on your local machine do the following to create the stroom database:\n# log into your MySQL server using your root credentials\nmysql --user=root --password=myrootpassword\n\nThen run the following commands in the MySQL shell:\ndrop database stroom;\ncreate database stroom;\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@localhost identified by 'stroompassword1';\nquit;\n\nLocal configuration file\nWhen running stroom in an IDE it is advisable to have a local configuration file to allow you to change settings locally without affecting the repository. The local configuration file is expected to live at ~/.stroom/stroom.conf. To create a default version of this file run the script stroom.conf.sh from within the root of the stroom git repository.\nAdd any properties from stroom.properties that you want different values for, e.g.\nstroom-resources\nAs a minimum to develop stroom you will need clones of the stroom and stroom-resources git repositories. stroom-resources provides the docker-compose configuration for running the many docker containers needed.\nHaving cloned stroom-resources navigate to the directory stroom-resources/bin and run the script\n./bounceIt.sh\n\nOn first run this will create a default version of the git-ignored file stroom-resources/bin/local.env which is intended for use by developers to configure the docker stacks to run.\nThis file is used to set a number of environment variables that docker compose will use to configure the various containers. The key environment variable in there is SERVICE_LIST. This is a space delimited list of the services for docker-compose to run. The services are all defined in stroom-resources/bin/compose/everything.yml and its dependencies. By default SERVICE_LIST runs a core stroom stack entirely in docker. \nTo run stroom in an IDE stroom needs to be removed from SERVICE_LIST, i.e. by commenting out the line SERVICE_LIST=\"${SERVICE_LIST} stroom\" in local.env. Having done this run stroom's core dependencies as follows:\n./bounceIt.sh\n\nVerify the Gradle build\nBefore trying to run Stroom in an IDE it is worth performing a Gradle build without the integration tests (as these take ~20mins to run) to verify the code compiles and all dependencies are present.\n./gradlew clean build -x integrationTest\n\nSample Data\nSome of the tests are dependant on some sample data and content being present in the database.  This sample data/content can also be useful for manually testing the application in development. The sample data/content is generated by a class called SetupSampleData.java. This class assumes that the database being used for Stroom is completely empty.\nFirst you need to create a run configuration for SetupSampleData.java\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main Class field enter SetupSampleData\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-integrationtest\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run SetupSampleData \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect SetupSampleData\n\nYou should now have a database populated with tables and data, providing you with some predefined feeds, data, translations, pipelines, dashboards, etc.\nRunning Stroom from the IDE\nThe user interface for Stroom is built using GWT (see GWT Project for more information or GWT specific documentation). As a result Stroom needs to be started up with GWT Dev Mode. Dev Mode handles the compilation of the Java user interface source into JavaScript and the source map that links client JavaScript back to Java source for client side debugging.\nStroom is run from the main method in Startup.java. Before running this you need to setup the run configuration:\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main class field enter Startup\nIn the Programme arguments field enter \n-startupUrl stroom.jsp -logLevel INFO -war . -logdir . -gen . -extra . -workDir . stroom.app.AppSuperDevMode\n\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-startup\n\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run Startup \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect Startup\n\nYou should eventually see the GWT Dev Mode window appear.\n\nInitially, some of the buttons shown above will not be visible as it is in the process of starting up. As soon as the Launch Default Browser button appears you are ready to open Stroom in a browser. You have two options:\n\nClick the Launch Default Browser button\nOpen your preferred browser and enter the URL http://127.0.0.1:8888\n\n\nNOTE: Stroom has been written with Google's Chrome browser in mind so has only been tested on Chrome. Behaviour in other browsers may vary. We would like to improve cross-browser support so please let us know about any browser incompatibilities that you find.\n\nIn the browser you will initially see the following:\n\nStarting Stroom\nInitialising context...\n\nOnce the context has been initialised you will see the Stroom blue background and a spinner while GWT compiles the front-end code. Once the code has been compiled you will be presented with the Stroom login page. Stroom in development mode uses simple username/password authentication. Enter the following credentials:\n\nUsername: admin\nPassword: admin\n\nRight click behaviour\nStroom overrides the defualt right click behaviour in the browser with its own context menu. For UI development it is often required to have access to the browser's context menu for example to inspect elements. To enable the browser's context menu you need to uncomment the following property in your stroom.conf file, e.g.\n#Uncomment this to enable browser's right click menu for development\nstroom.ui.oncontextmenu=\n\n"},"dev-guide/docker-running.html":{"url":"dev-guide/docker-running.html","title":"Running Stroom using Docker","keywords":"","body":"Running Stroom in Docker Containers\nThis is how to run Stroom and its peripheral services using Docker. \nRunning Stroom in Docker is the quickest and easiest way to get Stroom up and running. \n\nNOTE: The published docker images are intended for small scale testing or evaluation purposes and are currently un-tested in a production environment.\n\nStroom v6.x pre-release\nPrerequisites\nIn order to run Stroom v6.x using Docker you will need the following installed on the machine you intend to run Stroom on:\n\nA Linux-like shell environment with bash and curl.\ndocker CE (v17.12.0+)\ndocker-compose (v1.21.0+)\n\nInstall steps\nThis will install the core stack (Stroom and the peripheral services required to run Stroom).\nVisit stroom-resources/releases and find the latest stroom_core release and copy the link to the associated stroom_core*.tar.gz archive file.\nUsing stroom_core-v6.0-beta.11-2 as an example:\n# Set the release version to download\nexport STROOM_STACK_VER=\"stroom_core-v6.0-beta.11-2\"\n\n# Make the stack directory\nmkdir ${STROOM_STACK_VER}\n\n# Download and extract the Stroom stack into the directory stroom_core-v6.0-beta.11-2\ncurl -sL https://github.com/gchq/stroom-resources/releases/download/${STROOM_STACK_VER}/${STROOM_STACK_VER}.tar.gz | tar xz -C ${STROOM_STACK_VER}\n\n# Navigate into the new stack directory, where xxxx is the directory that has just been created\ncd ${STROOM_STACK_VER}\n\n# Start the stack\n./start.sh\n\nAlternatively if you understand the risks of redirecting web sourced content direct to bash, you can get the latest release using:\n# Download and extract the Stroom stack\nbash \nOn first run stroom will build the database schemas so this can take a minute or two. \nThe start.sh script will provide details of the various URLs that are available.\nOpen a browser (preferably Chrome) at https://localhost/stroom and login with:\n\nusername: admin (NOT an email address)\npassword: admin\n\nThe stroom stack comes supplied with self-signed certificates so you may need to accept a prompt warning you about visiting an untrusted site.\nStroom v5.x release\nPrerequisites\nIn order to run Stroom v5.x using Docker you will need the following installed on the machine you intend to run Stroom on:\n\nA Linux-like shell environment with bash and GNU sed/grep\ndocker CE (v17.12.0+)\ndocker-compose (v1.21.0+)\ngit\n\nInstall steps\n# Clone the stroom-resources git repository\ngit clone https://github.com/gchq/stroom-resources.git\n\n# Navigate to the bin directory in the repository\ncd stroom-resources/bin\n\n# Start the stroom v5.x stack using docker/docker-compose\n./bounceIt.sh -f env/stroom5.env\n\nOpen a browser (preferably Chrome) at http://localhost:8080/stroom and login with:\n\nusername: admin \npassword: admin\n\nDocker Hub links\nThe Stroom image\nThe Stroom Authentication image\nThe GCHQ organisation\n"},"dev-guide/components.html":{"url":"dev-guide/components.html","title":"Components","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Components\nStroom is broken down into separate components. Each component encapsulates a specific area of Stroom functionality and aids development by providing a single area of focus for new features and ensures separate components remain as loosely coupled as possible. Components can be tested in isolation and their interaction with other components easily understood by only allowing dependencies via minimal APIs.\nSome examples of components in Stroom include\n\nstroom-activity - Component for recording a users actions against a current activity\nstroom-dictionary - Component for storing lists of words.\nstroom-statistics - Component for recording statistical data, e.g. amount of data received in X minutes.\n\nIn the project structure a component appears as a first level subdirectory of the root project folder. Components have further subdirectories (modules) that make up the various parts of the component, e.g.\n\nstroom - Root project\nstroom-activity - The component\nstroom-activity-api - API module for stroom-activity\nstroom-activity-impl - Implementation of the API and other module implementation code\nstroom-activity-impl-db - Database persistence implementation used by impl\nstroom-activity-impl-db-jooq - JOOQ generated classes used by stroom-activity-impl-db\nstroom-activity-mock - Mock implementation for the stroom-activity API\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies between a modules components\nThe diagram below shows the dependencies between the different modules that make up a component as well as the internal dependencies within the impl module. The actual implementations used at runtime are determined by Guice bindings in whichever Guice modules are loaded by the application. Tests can bind mock implementations of a components API just by using the Guice module within the mock module.\n\nDependencies between components\nTypically a component will need to call out to other components to apply security constraints and to log user activity. These typical relationships are shown in the diagram below.\n\nComponent API, e.g. modules ending in -api\nAPI layer\nAll communication between components in stroom must be made via a component's API. The API provides the minimum surface area for communication between components and decouples dependencies between components to just the API code. For component testing purposes mock implementations of these APIs can be used to limit testing to just a single component.\nComponent API and service implementation, e.g. modules ending in -impl\nClient interaction - REST services and GWT Action Handlers\nThe uppermost layer of the server side code services requests from the client. The client may make restful calls as is the case for the new UI or will use Actions that are handles with ActionHandlers as is the case for the legacy GWT UI.\nSince this layer deals with all client interaction it should be responsible for creating audit logs for all user activity, e.g. accessing documents, searching etc. No audit logging should need to be performed at a lower level within the application as deeper levels have less knowledge of user intent since they may just be playing a part in the wider request.\nThe client interaction layer adds no logic and asks the underlying service layer to service the encapsulated request away from the REST endpoint wrapping code or GWT action handler code. This allows multiple types of endpoint to use the same underlying service layer. If a request requires the use of multiple services to form a response, this must be handled within the service layer by the primary service which will be responsible for any such orchestration.\nService layer\nThe service layer applies permission constraints to any requests being made so that only calls from identified and permitted users are allowed to proceed. The service layer performs all orchestration and business logic, and is responsible for all mutations of objects that will be persisted by the underlying persistence layer such as stamping objects to be updated with the current user and update time.\nThe service layer provides implementations for any API that the component may have.\nThe service layer provides the DAO (Data Access Object) API for the persistence layer to implement but maintains no knowledge of underlying persistence implementation, e.g. database queries.\nPersistence implementation, e.g. modules ending in -impl-db\nPersistence layer - DAOs\nThe persistence layer is an implementation of one or more DAOs specified in the service layer. The persistence layer provides no logic, it just stores and retrieves objects in a database or other persistence technology. If serialisation/de-serialisation is required in order to persist the object then that should also be performed by this layer so that no code above this layer has to care about this implementation detail.\nThe persistence layer does not apply security or permissions checking so should not need to reference the security API.\n"},"dev-guide/gitbook.html":{"url":"dev-guide/gitbook.html","title":"Building GitBook documentation","keywords":"","body":"Building the documentation\nStroom's documentation is built using GitBook. \nPrerequisites\nNPM\nYou need NPM to install the GitBook command line toolchain.
